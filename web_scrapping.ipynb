      "Description: How do the world’s top stars muster the poise and determination to stand on stage, despite the nerves and anxiety of having a bad performance? For both Beyoncé and Adele, the secret has been the creation of an alter ego.  Beyoncé’s was the assertive and empowered ‘Sasha Fierce’, who allowed her to perform with extra self-confidence and sensuality. “Usually when I hear the chords, when I put on my stilettos, like the moment right before when you’re nervous… then Sasha Fierce appears, and my posture and the way I speak and everything is different,” she told Oprah Winfrey in 2008. It was a strategy that she continued to use until 2010, when she felt she had matured enough to avoid the psychological crutch.  Inspired by an emotional meeting with Beyoncé herself, Adele followed suit, telling Rolling Stone magazine in 2011 about her creation of ‘Sasha Carter’. The persona was a combination of Beyoncé’s Sasha Fierce persona and the (real) country music star June Carter. Adele said the strategy helped her give her best to every performance during her breakout year.  Although the embodiment of a fictional persona may seem like a gimmick for pop stars, new research suggests there may be some real psychological benefits to the strategy. Adopting an alter ego is an extreme form of ‘self-distancing’, which involves taking a step back from our immediate feelings to allow us to view a situation more dispassionately.  Ethan Kross, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, has led much of this research over the past decade, showing that even small shifts in perspective can help people to gain control of their emotions.  In one study, participants were asked to think about a challenging event in the future, such as an important exam, in one of two different ways. The group in the “immersed” condition were told to picture it from the inside, as if they were in the middle of the situation, whereas those in the “distanced” condition were asked to picture it from afar – as if they were a fly on the wall. The differences were striking, with those taking the distanced viewpoint feeling much less anxious about the event, compared to the immersed group. The self-distancing also encouraged greater feelings of self-efficacy – the sense that they could pro-actively cope with the situation and achieve their goal.  Read the full article at BBC.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\tSensitive to Art & its Discontents\t\t\t\t\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s been an age-old trope in works of literature, poetry, and art for ages, but now science confirms it’s true: Life does indeed flash before your eyes when you die. \n",
      "\n",
      "When an 87-year-old epilepsy patient unexpectedly passed away during a brain scan, the scan found that his brain seemed to replay memories in the 30 seconds before and after his heart stopped beating, according to a recent study published in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience. \n",
      "\n",
      "The patient, whose name was kept private, suffered a heart attack, and due to his do-not-resuscitate status, the scientists were able to track his brain waves throughout the final moments of his life. The scan was conducted by an international team of 13 neuroscientists led by Raul Vicente of the University of Tartu in Estonia. \n",
      "\n",
      "The scientists were originally conducting electroencephalography (EEG) scans on the patient to detect and treat seizures. When he unexpectedly died, the EEG machine kept running, providing the scientists a first-of-its-kind glimpse into the brain activity of a dying human. \n",
      "\n",
      "“This is why it’s so rare, because you can’t plan this,” Ajmal Zemmar, one of the co-authors of the study, told Insider. “No healthy human is gonna go and have an EEG before they die, and in no sick patient are we going to know when they’re gonna die to record these signals.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The EEG brain scan found an oscillatory brain wave pattern in which activity in the brain’s alpha, beta, and theta bands relatively decreased and activity in the gamma band relatively increased. It’s thought that these oscillatory patterns, and an increase in gamma waves, suggest memory recall (the gamma band decreases external interference, allowing for deep inward concentration like recalling memories). Similar brain oscillations occur during meditation and dreaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first time this has been proven in a human, although the concept looms large in our collective imagination. It comes back to us from people who have experienced near-death experiences, defined as when the brain has transitioned into preparing for death. Research into these experiences has reported intense memory recall and a panoramic review of one’s life. They have also reported a hallucinatory and meditative state and a sense of transcendence and bliss. These accounts cross cultures and religions. \n",
      "\n",
      "The trope is so solidified it’s joked about in cartoons, like Family Guy, and used in movies like Babe: Pig in the City (Babe flees from a dog about to kill him).\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 2001 film Vanilla Sky, the character played by Tom Cruise leaps from a building and as he’s falling, he sees his childhood, his parents, a dog, and the women he’s loved throughout the years his life. In the 1998 action film Armageddon, Bruce Willis’s character sees memories of his daughter and wife a moment before dying in outer space. \n",
      "\n",
      "People have been describing this phenomenon for millennia. In The Republic, Plato tells the story of a warrior who returns from death and recounts leaving his body. Hieronymus Bosch’s painting “Ascent of the Blessed” (1500–1504) depicts bright, white light at the end of a tunnel, another experience reported in near-death experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous research into this phenomenon was largely based on anecdotal evidence. In a 2019 study, researchers compared stories of near-death experiences with stories of drug experiences, finding that ketamine, LSD, and the hallucinogenic DMT yielded strong similarities. Countless studies have examined the religious significance of near-death experiences, drawing on survivors’ accounts of transcendental and blissful states at the moment before they die. \n",
      "\n",
      "Research has not concluded why the brain does this. For now, it seems that a flood of memories, a feeling of transcendence, and eventual bliss are one last gift the world gives us before we leave it for good.\n",

      "Description: Painters at work notice details we’d ignore. From those details they develop delightful insights into reality. What do I mean? Let’s take a gander at Van Eyck’s “Arnolfini Portrait” to find out:\n",
      "\n",
      "Arnolfini Portrait, Jan van Eyck\n",
      "\n",
      "The most whimsical idea starts with what Van Eyck painted. Do you think anyone in the world has paid more attention to this room than Van Eyk has? Look at the prayer beads beside the mirror: \n",
      "\n",
      "Prayer beads\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t they seem uncannily real? Well, art historians think Van Eyck put them through a magnifying glass to get them this right. A practiced meditator would find it hard to stare at prayer beads for more than a few hours, while Van Eyck must have spent days. \n",
      "\n",
      "The more you look, the more details you uncover. Notice how rich the wife’s dress is: the intricate folds, the patterns, the material. I’m not sure anyone but the dressmaker could have scrutinized it with more care. And even the dog is gifted with attention; look at its fur! \n",
      "\n",
      "The doggo\n",
      "\n",
      "Try it yourself [1]. Pick a random spot and zoom into the painting. You’ll discover a world of detail you hadn’t seen. From here, it’s safe to say that at least Van Eyck noticed details we’d ignore.\n",
      "\n",
      "But is this true for all painters? Van Eyck was known to bring his paintings to life with layers of detail. How about someone like Monet, who didn’t follow that strategy? Let’s look at his water lilies:\n",
      "\n",
      "Water Lilies, Claude Monet\n",
      "\n",
      "You’d be surprised. Monet actually created 250 paintings of water lilies in the same pond, to study the effect of light there. You saw 1 of 250, a devotion that engrossed close to three decades of his life. How much more do you think you’d see in a pond of water lilies, if you spent 30 years looking? \n",
      "\n",
      "Our brains ignore details and see the essence of things. We barely notice the prayer beads, and wouldn’t take more than a few glances at the reflection of water lilies. The brush, however, forced Van Eyck and Monet to stop and see more. From there is born the premise that painters notice details we’d ignore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now details by themselves, although interesting, aren’t general. Who cares if Van Eyck was intimately aware of prayer beads or if Monet had a deeper understanding of a pond? Let’s zoom out and see some of the larger implications. Back to the Arnolfini Portrait:\n",
      "\n",
      "What's up with the fruit?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why is there fruit by the window? How about the clogs? Do you see all the various symmetrical arrangements: the bead and the broom, the grey clogs and the red clogs, the couple’s position? And what about the colors? Why is the husband wearing a dark purple coat, and not a red one? Look at the wife’s gesture. It’s so maidenly, but why?\n",
      "\n",
      "PG originally shared this idea in a masterful essay [2], and I’ll adopt it here. Every painting Van Eyck made had a purpose; to affect his audience. He may have wanted to please, shock, or dazzle; the spectrum of human emotions were fully available to him. This also meant that every painting worked doubly as a test; did it achieve its purpose? The more Van Eyck painted, the more he discovered exactly what worked. \n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly but surely details amalgamated into patterns, and Van Eyck began to map our subconscious drivers. He discovered our inborn love of symmetry for example, and used it to masterful advantage throughout the painting. He discovered the gestures that make us feel innocence, and now we can’t help but see it in the wife. [3]\n",
      "\n",
      "When we look at his work, feelings and thoughts burgeon up, but we can’t put our finger on why. Well, Van Eyck could put his finger on why, and there comes the painter’s first insight: they learn what affects humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already we hit an interesting philosophical plane. When you learn what affects humans, you’re bound to ask why. But it gets grander.\n",
      "\n",
      "I left the coolest part of this painting last. Look at the mirror:\n",
      "\n",
      "Hacker level 1000\n",
      "\n",
      "Van Eyk painted the reflection! You can even see two folks peering back at the couple. [4] \n",
      "\n",
      "Outside the effort this must have taken, imagine what Van Eyck learned. How deeply have you thought about how light reflects in convex mirrors? I’d bet a lot less than Van Eyck after this painting. In fact, some have tried to see just how accurate Van Eyck was, and compared his depiction with what a real convex mirror would have reflected [5]: \n",
      "\n",
      "Van Eyck vs reality\n",
      "\n",
      "a is Van Eyck’s work, and b,c,d are the mathematically correct versions. The similarity is remarkable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not only did Van Eyck have to learn what affected humans, but the brush forced him to see deeply into the real world. The mirror is just the beginning. Imagine what he learned trying to draw the shadows. What about the chandelier? Here we hit the painter’s second insight: they learn to unravel the secrets of nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a painters master these insights, they take the canvas to heights we couldn’t have imagined before. For example, look at Botticelli’s “The Birth of Venus”\n",
      "\n",
      "Birth of Venus, Sandro Botticelli\n",
      "\n",
      "Stuff like symmetry here is obvious. But, glance over Venus’ neck:\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s up with the neck?\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s longer than a normal human neck! Or look at her hands and shoulders, a bit lower and longer than normal. Botticelli hacked our minds. He knew what pushed our buttons, so he didn’t just describe reality, he accentuated it. He showed us a view of Venus’s elegance that could only be achieved through painting. [6]\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, painters can eschew reality’s constraints in ground-breaking ways, and show us what our eyes could never see:\n",
      "\n",
      "Starry Night, Van Gogh\n",
      "\n",
      "These insights touch on what makes painting art. Painting isn’t a rote exercise, but an inquiry into reality and perception. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a jump: I think programmers have a similar experience [7]. Programmers at work notice details we’d ignore. From those details they develop delightful insights into reality. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, programming is not as far along as painting yet; our art has just begun. Like painting in the early renaissance, our work is crude, but we’re accruing insight after insight. What are these insights? \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s find out by answering a question: what would a programmer notice if they made an app for painters? We’ll call it pixel.fyi, and we’ll help painters draw stuff online. Here’s our goal:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Goal\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we get into what programmers notice, let’s learn what programmers do. Today our devices are so sophisticated that they seem intelligent, as though they “understand” what we want from them. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, this intelligence is an illusion built upon illusions, and is perhaps the masterwork of the pioneer programmers of our time. Computers aren’t intelligent. Instead, they do simple things, like add and subtract numbers, very quickly. \n",
      "\n",
      "To a get sense, here’s the great-great-grandfather of our modern computer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding Machine\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we have three light switches labeled “1”, “2”, and “3”. We also have three light bulbs labeled “3”, “4”, and “5”. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, would it be possible to wire things up so that if someone turned on our “1” and “2” light switch, the “3” light bulb would turn on? \n",
      "\n",
      "It doesn’t seem so difficult, and we’d hardly call it intelligence, but if we did this we would have created a machine that could add 1 and 2! \n",
      "\n",
      "That’s cool, but here’s something startling: though crude, our invention adds numbers faster than any human ever could. The answer comes at the speed of light through a wire; this means our machine can make millions of calculations by the time you finish this sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, our machine also has the same advantage as modern computers, in that the answer comes quickly, and the same disadvantage, in that fundamentally there is no intelligence. \n",
      "\n",
      "So what’s the big difference? Our machine is specific; it can only add 1 to 3. Modern computers are general; they can do any computation. Instead of wiring things up a specific way, modern computers let us use a computer language to simulate wiring things up in any way we like. It looks something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "With that code, it’s as though we “wired up” our great-great-grandfather machine! \n",
      "\n",
      "We come to the essence of what programmers do. They write precise instructions in a computer language, to get computers to solve problems. Precise is the key word here, because at the end of the day it all boils down to switches that turn on and off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, back to programmers today. The most whimsical idea starts with what they create. For example, in order for pixel.fyi to work, at the very least we need to let our users draw simple shapes, like circles or squares. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, how would a computer draw a circle? Switches have no concept of “circle”.  Here’s one idea: \n",
      "\n",
      "Circle\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s imagine the monitor is like a grid, where we can turn each pixel on or off. A circle is really all the pixels that are a specific distance away from a center point. If we could just figure out all the pixels to turn on, we’d have a circle! \n",
      "\n",
      "And how do we figure out those pixels? Let’s remember some math:\n",
      "\n",
      "Trig\n",
      "\n",
      "We could draw a right-angle triangle going from the center to a point on our circle at any particular degree. We can then use trigonometry to find the x and y coordinates for the point! All of a sudden, we have a plan to draw a circle. Here’s how a programmer could express it in a computer language:\n",
      "\n",
      "For every degree between 0 and 360,  we calculate the x and y coordinates, and we have our pixel. We can then turn_on  pixels, and voila, our circle is born! [8] Here’s how this would look: \n",
      "\n",
      "So what’s the consequence of all of this? Look how much we learned about circles. Not only did we breath life to trigonometry, but we discovered the “essence” of a circle: it’s all the points that are equidistant from a center. And if you think about it, this is the same definition for a sphere! A sphere is all the points that are equidistant from a center in three dimensions. And now for a mind-bender: this must mean that “circle” exists in infinite dimensions; there’s a “4-D circle”, with points equidistant from a center! [9]\n",
      "\n",
      "4-D Circle?!\n",
      "\n",
      "Our brains ignore details and see the essence of things. When we look at circles, the only property likely to burgeon up is that they’re round. The computer language however, forced us to see more. Sound familiar? From here is born the premise that programmers notice details we’d ignore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now details by themselves, though interesting, aren’t general. Who cares if we know more about circles than the average person? Well, let’s zoom out to see some of the larger implications. We can kick off with a roundabout journey, and take a look at algebra. \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you remember the kind of homework you did in middle school? Stuff like: \n",
      "\n",
      "x + 2 = 5\n",
      "\n",
      "Here,  x is 3. Now, where did x come from? When we write x, we are using the concept of a variable. But variables didn’t always exist! They were only invented in the 16th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "What did mathematicians do before? They used words. Instead of x + 2 = 5, they would write: \n",
      "\n",
      "There is such a number, that when you add 2 to it, you get 5. What is this number?\n",
      "\n",
      "You can already get a sense of how annoying this could become. If all you have are sentences, even the area of a triangle can get taxing to describe. With variables, we could write:\n",
      "\n",
      "1/2 w * h\n",
      "\n",
      "Without variables, we’d be stuck with:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pick one side of the triangle. Measure this side. Now measure the straight line that connects from the opposite angle, to the side you chose. Multiply these two numbers together, and divide by two to get the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "At some point, problems get so complicated that we can’t solve them with words anymore; no person’s head could fit the space required. That’s where variables come to the rescue. x isn’t just any mundane character, but a shorthand for our brain: what was intractable before can now fit into a middle schooler’s head. \n",
      "\n",
      "That's thrilling and begs the question: what other concepts exist like this that we haven't discovered yet?\n",
      "\n",
      "Programmers think about this question all the time. Why? Let’s look at our code for clues: \n",
      "\n",
      "We were a bit mistaken here. We assumed our center was at [0,0], and our radius was 20. What if we wanted to draw another circle, but this time with a center of [5, 5] and a radius of 15?\n",
      "\n",
      "We could write this: \n",
      "\n",
      "But already this is getting hard to think about. What if we wanted to draw a hundred different circles? We can’t just keep copying and pasting. We’d barely get to triangles before our program spilled out of our heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re forced to invent a new concept. Here’s one; what if our language had a “snippet”? A way for us to say draw_circle, with different options for center and radius: \n",
      "\n",
      "draw_circle\n",
      "\n",
      "This is how it could work:\n",
      "\n",
      "def becomes our “snippet” making concept. Whenever we write draw_circle(…), it’s as though we run the code inside it, with center and radius set differently. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just like variables, def gives our minds a shorthand to think with. Now drawing a hundred circles is easy peasy. Not only that, but wherever someone sees draw_circle, they no longer need to think about how it works; if we find a more efficient way to draw a circle for example, we could change our snippet and nobody would be the wiser. [10] \n",
      "\n",
      "def is just the beginning. Let’s keep going. Look at draw_circle again:\n",
      "\n",
      "We can write it like this, but what’s really going on here? \n",
      "\n",
      "If you think about it, we’re transforming one list (of degrees) to another list (of pixels). If we use an analogy in the real world, it could look like an assembly line:\n",
      "\n",
      "Assembly Lines\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s one assembly line with degrees and a worker beside it. The worker picks up each degrees, figures out the corresponding pixel, and adds them to the pixel assembly line. \n",
      "\n",
      "It took a sentence to explain, but it’s a valuable concept, and we can generalize it. What if we called this map ? A worker “maps” degre``e``s to pixels. Here’s how how our program could look now: \n",
      "\n",
      "Now whenever we see map, the assembly line idea pops into our head. Not only does it give us a shorthand, but it opens up a new world; what else goes on in assembly lines, and can we use those concepts to help us think better? [11]\n",
      "\n",
      "Just with circles, we were forced to invent snippets and map. Imagine all that we’d discover if we kept going: what about shadows? what about layers?\n",
      "\n",
      "The computer can only understand precise instructions, and there are only so many precise instructions we can keep in our heads. The more complicated the programs we write, the more we’re forced to invent new concepts. From there comes the programmer’s first insight: they learn what helps humans think better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already we hit an interesting philosophical plane. When you learn what helps humans think better, you’re bound to ask why. But it gets grander.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now as we progress on with pixel.fyi, we’d want to support “undo” and “redo”. If a painter drew a smiley and didn’t like the nose, they should be able to “undo” it: \n",
      "\n",
      "Scratch the nose\n",
      "\n",
      "How could we support this? If we just turn_on(draw_circle(...)) all over the place, there’s no way for us to know what the last instruction would be. It’s time for us to look for a new concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a new idea. What if we kept track of the painting over time? Something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "Painting over time\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a list that represents time. Any change we make creates a new “version” of the painting, and adds it to the list. A painting at a point in time is just all the pixels that are turned on then.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Current” points to the version we show our user. When they press “undo” or “redo”, we simply move “current” to another version in our list. \n",
      "\n",
      "In our computer language, it could look something like this: \n",
      "\n",
      "This would support undo / redo, but it also opens up some interesting questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, consider that when we think about a “painting” in real life, we think about it as the end result. But here, we think about a painting as all the versions that existed throughout time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Two views\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s convenient to think this way for undo and redo, but isn’t life actually like this? Unfortunately, we are stuck in 3 dimensions and can't travel through time, but if we could, we would see that identity encompasses time. A painting begun, even if it goes through change after change, is the same painting in the end. That’s the same with people; no cell in your body is existed when you were 5, but you’re still you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another interesting idea, how does change happen? When we draw, we think we irrevocably modify the canvas. But if we could travel through time, we’d see something different: the canvas would evolve. After all, if you add a nose and go back in time, you’d still see the canvas without the nose, so how could the canvas have been irrevocably modified? \n",
      "\n",
      "As it turns out, my friend Dennis [12] was so intrigued by this idea that he once explored a 3D animation for it, and it was about painting to boot. Here’s his rendering of a painting that evolves over time:\n",
      "\n",
      "So darn interesting. We’ve lived in four dimensions all along but never saw it like this. \n",
      "\n",
      "And the insights don’t stop. Remember, this is a multiplayer drawing app. Could “Stopa” and “Joe” draw a shape at the same time? \n",
      "\n",
      "Oops\n",
      "\n",
      "This couldn’t happen when painting in real life; our hands don’t move fast enough. But a computer moves real fast; it’s certainly possible that Joe sees a blue shape and makes it red, but by the time this completes, Stopa sees the same blue shape and makes it green. \n",
      "\n",
      "This problem opens an interesting question about how we perceive anything in life! If your friend is in front of you for example, how do you see them? \n",
      "\n",
      "Perception\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, light bounces around the room. Some of it hits your friend and reflects into your eyes. Your eyes then process the light, which activates signals in your brain. Those signals in turn activate more signals, until a thought pops up: “I see my friend”.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this takes time, right? It feels instant, but it takes time for light to move and for signals to activate in your brain. This means then, that everything you see is from the past! \n",

      "That’s where the best programmers are today. Our work is crude, but we’re questioning assumptions and constantly looking for inspiration from nature. It’s so early that some of the best ideas are prime picking, and the state of the art evolves every year. We can already see astonishing results at the edges, like computers transcribing human speech with better accuracy or self-driving cars whizzing around roads.\n",

      "We’re left in an exciting state. I’m curious to know what transcendence will look like in our field. Computers are faster than any natural organ in our body.

What kind of concepts will the Michelangelo programmers of the future be using? \n",

      "It strikes me, that perhaps all creative pursuits are like this. This essay was born from a conversation, where I tried to explain why I found programming so invigorating. I thought I’d start with painting as the metaphor. However, putting words to paper had me discovering details I had ignored. I was plunged into book after book on art and even expanded my thinking on programming. [15]\n",

      "\n",
      "Disclaimer: This is by no means an attempt to tell you to not be technical at all, but rather a series of thoughts about situations under which thinking in terms of implementation can remove more value than it adds. I am also not an expert in product or engineering - just someone who is trying to write down my thoughts :)\n",
      "\n",
      "Be less technical. That’s it.\n",
      "\n",
      "You’re an engineer. You solve problems* by designing solutions to them that run on really advanced calculators. You do this for a reason. Perhaps that reason is that you are overwhelmingly concerned with the speed and logistics of grocery delivery, or maybe you’d just like to buy some groceries for yourself at the end of the month. Whatever the reason, you solve problems and you’re likely damn good at it (the solving of problems that is, not delivering groceries).\n",
      "\n",
      "But you need to Be less technical when describing and thinking about how to solve those far-reaching problems and the atomic** ones that occur along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "That may sound blasphemous, but please bear with me for a second (or a few minutes). I am not saying that you should reject everything you’ve learned and cultivated over the years, but rather - you should learn how to communicate those things to someone who hasn’t had that same experience of learning and cultivation as you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over time, our species has developed and refined thousands of languages. Structured forms of communication that are, for the most part, highly interoperable. That is to say, we have the means to translate between the most popular languages with relative ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has enabled us to think about humanity, its ongoing survival, and its conflicts across geographies and cultures.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have developed structured, formal rules for transferring information between each other to ensure that we can make informed decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "By that definition, the way we communicate with each other (by speaking, writing, illustrating, etc) - becomes a way for us to describe the problems we experience, and by extension - reason about solving those problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Software engineering, in my opinion, has developed its own formal language for communication. It is so pervasive and commonplace in conversation on the day to day, that I would go as far as to say that it is in a way a steady-state natural language that lives outside of English (and perhaps has analogues in other spoken languages that I am not aware of).\n",
      "\n",
      "As an engineer who operates in this environment*** - you would have mastered this language quite quickly - without realizing that it can be incredibly exclusionary.\n",
      "\n",
      "This language is technical. (Which can be a term used in other professional disciplines to refer to language constructs specifically adapted to their discipline).\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem when describing and thinking and speaking about problems in technical language, is that it automatically excludes people who do not operate in that immediate environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "This might raise a flag and question for some people.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But surely, by working in tech, you should know these things?”\n",
      "\n",
      "At face value, this may be a solid assumption and question. But this ignores the fact that not everyone that works in “tech” is working near engineering. That is, they are not tasked with producing solutions in code. They may work in a customer-facing role, or perhaps are exceptional at designing user interfaces. They have a different technical language.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is when it becomes especially important to be less technical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Software is not the only discipline that has an exclusionary technical language. Mathematics, which is the lingua franca of physics (among other “hard” sciences), is typically exclusionary at the highest levels (take for instance the Navier-Stokes equations - a set of partial differential equations that was presented to me as a first-year engineering student that scared me into computer science). That has not however inhibited some of the world's greatest minds from attempting to make physics accessible (see: A Brief History of Time)\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point to be aware of is that languages and the barriers between them can introduce constraints on how many “bytes” of information we can transfer between each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the asymmetrical information relationship between the German phrase:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Schadenfreude**”**\n",
      "\n",
      "And its “equivalent” English translation:\n",
      "\n",
      "“...means joy over some harm or misfortune suffered by another” - Merriam Webster\n",
      "\n",
      "Though not a perfectly applicable example, we can see that the English language, due to its rules and formalization, does not have a single word that describes the complexity behind the feeling of “Schadenfreude”. This is an inherent constraint in the English language as it pertains to its translation to German.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, regular English, may not have a single word or phrase that encapsulates the intricacies involved in implementing, for example, a full-text search engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a constraint that we have to be aware exists when talking about problems and the solutions. Discussions of ElasticSearch, Lucene and inverted indices may not transfer as much useful information as we think to our audience and peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "A word in regular English, e.g. “Search” - may not have a well-defined technical translation outside the implementation. This restricts our ability to think about the problem because suddenly, we are focused on implementing a search engine without fully understanding what someone might have meant by “search”. (Of course, this is a reductive view and assumes that engineers are focused solely on implementation detail 😉).\n",
      "\n",
      "It is our job to make sure we communicate and problem solve using a shared set of rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "This doesn’t warrant a paragraph or long explanation. The simple answer is that you have already got the interoperability layer between technical language and “regular English” in your head. As a consequence of understanding the technical details, you are best equipped to be the translation layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be less technical. Be an interface for the technical details. Translate.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that said, there are times to be technical, or else the language wouldn’t exist. I think the nuance is that technical communication needs to happen at the right level of granularity. I would err on the side of caution of being deeply technical when the audience and your peers are for the most part, not engineers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would be more technical in discussions and situations that are centered on scaling systems and improving their speed, but even in these cases, I would look first for the “regular English” motivations for scale and speed. Perhaps other solutions exist outside engineering?\n",
      "\n",
      "A contrived example of focusing less on technical details and paying more attention to regular English communication:\n",
      "\n",
      "A: Our users are complaining our system is slow!\n",
      "B: Ah okay, maybe we need to optimize how fast our pages load up, it's probably an API problem - engineering can fix that!\n",
      "C: Hold on, what part of our system is slow? Is it the app?\n",
      "A: Oh I don’t know - it was one of our users that uses our app on his phone a lot.\n",
      "C: Hmm, perhaps he has a slow data connection is slow? Can we look at his network speed on a dashboard or something?\n",
      "\n",
      "The simplest advice I have is to write more regular English. As engineers we are:\n",
      "\n",
      "But we are hardly writing for non-engineer humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is my honest belief that to be highly effective at problem-solving for people, we have to be world-class communicators. Writing is a good start.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second piece of advice would be to pay attention to highly successful consumer technology and open source projects. Focus on the decisions they’ve made that drastically changed their product, why those decisions came to be, and the technical constraints and impact those decisions had (and the way engineers had to translate those decisions into code, and back).\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did Twitter increase the word count on tweets several years back? And what was the implementation detail that backed that up? What technical constraints might they have faced? And how do you hypothesize their engineering team communicated those constraints?\n",
      "\n",
      "To be quite honest, being less technical is something I am still learning how to do, so I do not have all the answers, and I doubt I ever will - but I think that if we as engineers can describe problems without leaning excessively on technical details, we’re all going to build better solutions.\n",

      "Malware designed to target industrial control systems like power grids, factories, water utilities, and oil refineries represents a rare species of digital badness. So when the United States government warns of a piece of code built to target not just one of those industries, but potentially all of them, critical infrastructure owners worldwide should take notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday, the Department of Energy, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the NSA, and the FBI jointly released an advisory about a new hacker toolset potentially capable of meddling with a wide range of industrial control system equipment. More than any previous industrial control system hacking toolkit, the malware contains an array of components designed to disrupt or take control of the functioning of devices, including programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that are sold by Schneider Electric and OMRON and are designed to serve as the interface between traditional computers and the actuators and sensors in industrial environments. Another component of the malware is designed to target Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) servers—the computers that communicate with those controllers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the most expansive industrial control system attack tool that anyone has ever documented,\" says Sergio Caltagirone, the vice president of threat intelligence at industrial-focused cybersecurity firm Dragos, which contributed research to the advisory and published its own report about the malware. Researchers at Mandiant, Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft, and Schneider Electric also contributed to the advisory. “It’s like a Swiss Army knife with a huge number of pieces to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dragos says the malware has the ability to hijack target devices, disrupt or prevent operators from accessing them, permanently brick them, or even use them as a foothold to give hackers access to other parts of an industrial control system network. He notes that while the toolkit, which Dragos calls “Pipedream,” appears to specifically target Schneider Electric and OMRON PLCs, it does so by exploiting underlying software in those PLCs known as Codesys, which is used far more broadly across hundreds of other types of PLCs. This means that the malware could easily be adapted to work in almost any industrial environment. “This toolset is so big that it’s basically a free-for-all,” Caltagirone says. “There’s enough in here for everyone to worry about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The CISA advisory refers to an unnamed “APT actor” that developed the malware toolkit, using the common acronym APT to mean advanced persistent threat, a term for state-sponsored hacker groups. It's far from clear where the government agencies found the malware, or which country's hackers created it—though the timing of the advisory follows warnings from the Biden administration about the Russian government making preparatory moves to carry out disruptive cyberattacks in the midst of its invasion of Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dragos also declined to comment on the malware's origin. But Caltagirone says it doesn't appear to have been actually used against a victim—or at least, it hasn't yet triggered actual physical effects on a victim's industrial control systems. “We have high confidence it hasn’t been deployed yet for disruptive or destructive effects,” says Caltagirone.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the toolkit's adaptability means it could be used against practically any industrial environment, from manufacturing to water treatment, Dragos points out that the apparent focus on Schneider Electric and OMRON PLCs does suggest that the hackers may have built it with power grid and oil refineries—particularly liquified natural gas facilities—in mind, given Schneider's wide use in electric utilities and OMRON's broad adoption in the oil and gas sector. Caltagirone suggests the ability to send commands to servo motors in those petrochemical facilities via OMRON PLCs would be particularly dangerous, with the ability to cause “destruction or even loss of life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The CISA advisory doesn't point to any particular vulnerabilities in the devices or software the Pipedream malware targets, though Caltagirone says it does exploit multiple zero-day vulnerabilities—previously unpatched hackable software flaws—that are still being fixed. He notes, however, that even patching those vulnerabilities won't prevent most of Pipedream's capabilities, as it's largely designed to hijack the intended functionality of target devices and send legitimate commands in the protocols they use. The CISA advisory includes a list of measures that infrastructure operators should take to protect their operations, from limiting industrial control systems' network connections to implementing monitoring systems for ICS systems, in particular, that send alerts for suspicious behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "When WIRED reached out to Schneider Electric and OMRON, a Schneider spokesperson responded in a statement that the company has closely collaborated with the US government and security firm Mandiant and that they together “identified and developed protective measures to defend against” the newly revealed attack toolkit. “This is an instance of successful collaboration to deter threats on critical infrastructure before they occur and further underscores how public-private partnerships are instrumental to proactively detect and counter threats before they can be deployed,” the company added. OMRON didn't immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discovery of the Pipedream malware toolkit represents a rare addition to the handful of malware specimens found in the wild that target industrial control systems (ICS) software. The first and still most notorious example of that sort of malware remains Stuxnet, the US- and Israeli-created code that was uncovered in 2010 after it was used to destroy nuclear enrichment centrifuges in Iran. More recently, the Russian hackers known as Sandworm, part of the Kremlin's GRU military intelligence agency, deployed a tool called Industroyer or Crash Override to trigger a blackout in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in late 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next year, Kremlin-linked hackers infected systems at the Saudi Arabian oil refinery Petro Rabigh with a piece of malware known as Triton or Trisis, which was designed to target its safety systems—with potentially catastrophic physical consequences—but instead triggered two shutdowns of the plant's operations. Then, just last week, Russia's Sandworm hackers were detected using a new variant of their of Industroyer code to target a regional electrical utility in Ukraine, though Ukrainian officials say they managed to detect the attack and avert a blackout.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pipedream advisory serves as a particularly troubling new entry in the rogue's gallery of ICS malware, however, given the breadth of its functionality. But its revelation—apparently before it could be used for disruptive effects—comes in the midst of a larger crackdown by the Biden administration on potential hacking threats to critical infrastructure systems, particularly from Russia. Last month, for instance, the Justice Department unsealed indictments against two Russian hacker groups with a history of targeting power grids and petrochemical systems. One indictment named for the first time one of the hackers allegedly responsible for the Triton malware attack in Saudi Arabia and also accused him and his coconspirators of targeting US refineries. A second indictment named three agents of Russia's FSB intelligence agency as members of a notorious hacker group known as Berserk Bear, responsible for years of electric utility hacking. And then early this month the FBI took measures to disrupt a botnet of networking devices controlled by Sandworm, still the only hackers in history known to have triggered blackouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as the government has taken measures to call out and even disarm those disruptive hackers, Pipedream represents a powerful malware toolkit in unknown hands—and one from which infrastructure operators need to take measures to protect themselves, says Caltagirone. “This is not a small deal,” he says. “It’s a clear and present danger to the safety of industrial control systems.”\n",

      "\n",
      "When neuroscientist Jakob Seidlitz took his 15-month-old son to the paediatrician for a check-up last week, he left feeling unsatisfied. There wasn’t anything wrong with his son — the youngster seemed to be developing at a typical pace, according to the height and weight charts the physician used. What Seidlitz felt was missing was an equivalent metric to gauge how his son’s brain was growing. “It is shocking how little biological information doctors have about this critical organ,” says Seidlitz, who is based at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.\n",

      "Soon, he might be able to change that. Working with colleagues, Seidlitz has amassed more than 120,000 brain scans — the largest collection of its kind — to create the first comprehensive growth charts for brain development. The charts show visually how human brains expand quickly early in life and then shrink slowly with age. The sheer magnitude of the study, published in Nature on 6 April1, has stunned neuroscientists, who have long had to contend with reproducibility issues in their research, in part because of small sample sizes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is expensive, meaning that scientists are often limited in the number of participants they can enrol in experiments.\n",

      "“The massive data set they assembled is extremely impressive and really sets a new standard for the field,” says Angela Laird, a cognitive neuroscientist at Florida International University in Miami.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, the authors caution that their database isn’t completely inclusive — they struggled to gather brain scans from all regions of the globe. The resulting charts, they say, are therefore just a first draft, and further tweaks would be needed to deploy them in clinical settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the charts are eventually rolled out to paediatricians, great care will be needed to ensure that they are not misinterpreted, says Hannah Tully, a paediatric neurologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. “A big brain is not necessarily a well-functioning brain,” she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because brain structure varies significantly from person to person, the researchers had to aggregate a huge number of scans to create an authoritative set of growth charts with statistical significance. That’s no easy task, says Richard Bethlehem, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK, and a co-author of the study. Instead of running thousands of scans themselves, which would take decades and be prohibitively costly, the researchers turned to already-completed neuroimaging studies.\n",

      "Bethlehem and Seidlitz sent e-mails to researchers all over the world asking if they would share their neuroimaging data for the project. The duo was amazed by the number of replies, which they attribute to the COVID-19 pandemic giving researchers less time in their laboratories and more time than usual with their e-mail inboxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In total, the team aggregated 123,894 MRI scans from 101,457 people, who ran the gamut from fetuses 16 weeks after conception to 100-year-old adults. The scans included brains from neurotypical people, as well as people with a variety of medical conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, and neurocognitive differences, including autism spectrum disorder. The researchers used statistical models to extract information from the images, and ensure that the scans were directly comparable, no matter what type of MRI machine had been used.\n",

      "The end result is a set of charts plotting several key brain metrics by age. Some metrics, such as grey-matter volume and mean cortical thickness (the width of the grey matter) peak early in a person’s development, whereas the volume of white matter (found deeper in the brain) tends to peak by around age 30 (see ‘Brain change’). The data on ventricular volume (the amount of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain), in particular, surprised Bethlehem. Scientists knew that this volume increases with age, because it is typically associated with brain atrophy, but Bethlehem was shocked by how rapidly it tends to grow in late adulthood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study comes on the heels of a bombshell paper published in Nature on 16 March2 showing that most brain-imaging experiments contain too few scans to reliably detect links between brain function and behaviour, meaning that their conclusions might be incorrect. Given this finding, Laird expects the field to move towards adopting a framework similar to the one used by Seidlitz and Bethlehem, to increase statistical power.\n",

      "To amass so many data sets is akin to a “diplomatic masterpiece”, says Nico Dosenbach, a neuroscientist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, who co-authored the 16 March study. He says this is the scale on which researchers should operate when aggregating brain images.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the size of the data set, Seidlitz, Bethlehem and their colleagues acknowledge that their study suffers from a problem endemic to neuroimaging studies — a remarkable lack of diversity. The brain scans they collected come mainly from North America and Europe, and disproportionately reflect populations that are white, university-aged, urban and affluent. This limits the generalizability of the findings, says Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge. The study includes only three data sets from South America and one from Africa — accounting for around 1% of all the brain scans used in the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billions of people worldwide lack access to MRI machines, making diverse brain-imaging data difficult to come by, Laird says. But the authors haven’t stopped trying. They have launched a website where they intend to update their growth charts in real time as they receive more brain scans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another challenge was determining how to give proper credit to the owners of the brain scans used to construct the charts. Some of the scans came from open-access data sets, but others were closed to researchers. Most of the closed-data scans hadn’t yet been processed in a way that would allow them to be incorporated into the growth charts, so their owners did extra work to share them. These scientists were then named as authors of the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the owners of the open data sets received only a citation in the paper — which doesn’t hold as much prestige for researchers seeking funding, collaborations and promotions. Seidlitz, Bethlehem and their colleagues processed these data. In most cases, Bethlehem says that there was essentially no direct contact with the owners of these data sets. The paper lists about 200 authors and cites the work of hundreds of others who contributed brain scans.\n",

      "There are a number of reasons that data sets might be closed: for instance, to protect the privacy of health data, or because researchers don’t have the resources to make them public. But this doesn’t make it fair that the researchers who opened their data sets didn’t get authorship, the authors say. In their paper’s Supplementary Information, they argue that the situation “perversely disincentivises open science, since the people who do most to make their data openly available could be least likely to merit recognition”. Bethlehem and Seidlitz contend that authorship guidelines from journals, including Nature — which say that each author is expected to have made “substantial contributions” to, for example, the analysis or interpretation of data — are an obstacle. (Nature’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher.)\n",
      "\n",
      "A Nature spokesperson responds that the issue was “considered carefully by the editors and authors according to our authorship policies” and that “all datasets were appropriately credited per our data citation policy”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, these concerns can be traced back to how researchers are evaluated by the scientific enterprise, says Kaja LeWinn, a social epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies neurodevelopment. She says that it’s incumbent on all of the relevant stakeholders — including funders, journals and research institutions — to re-evaluate how brain science can be properly recognized and rewarded, especially as these types of large-scale study become more common.\n",

      "[Editor’s note: The full, interactive map is available below.]\n",
      "\n",
      "All of nature springs from a handful of components — the fundamental particles — that interact with one another in only a few different ways. In the 1970s, physicists developed a set of equations describing these particles and interactions. Together, the equations formed a succinct theory now known as the Standard Model of particle physics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Standard Model is missing a few puzzle pieces (conspicuously absent are the putative particles that make up dark matter, those that convey the force of gravity, and an explanation for the mass of neutrinos), but it provides an extremely accurate picture of almost all other observed phenomena.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet for a framework that encapsulates our best understanding of nature’s fundamental order, the Standard Model still lacks a coherent visualization. Most attempts are too simple, or they ignore important interconnections or are jumbled and overwhelming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the most common visualization, which shows a periodic table of particles:\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach doesn’t offer insight into the relationships between the particles. The force-carrying particles (namely the photon, which conveys the electromagnetic force; the W and Z bosons, which convey the weak force; and the gluons, which convey the strong force) are put on the same footing as the matter particles those forces act between — quarks, electrons and their kin. Furthermore, key properties like “color” are left out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another representation was developed for the 2013 film Particle Fever: \n",
      "\n",
      "While this visualization properly emphasizes the centrality of the Higgs boson — the linchpin of the Standard Model, for reasons explained below — the Higgs is placed next to the photon and gluon, even though in reality the Higgs doesn’t affect those particles. And the quadrants of the circle are misleading — implying, for instance, that the photon only couples to the particles it touches, which isn’t the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chris Quigg, a particle physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, has been thinking about how to visualize the Standard Model for decades, hoping that a more powerful visual representation would help familiarize people with the known particles of nature and prompt them to think about how these particles might fit into a larger, more complete theoretical framework. Quigg’s visual representation shows more of the Standard Model’s underlying order and structure. He calls his scheme the “double simplex” representation, because the left-handed and right-handed particles of nature each form a simplex — a generalization of a triangle. We have adopted Quigg’s scheme and made further modifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s build up the double simplex from scratch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matter particles come in two main varieties, leptons and quarks. (Note that, for every kind of matter particle in nature, there is also an antimatter particle, which has the same mass but is opposite in every other way. As other Standard Model visualizations have done, we elide antimatter, which would form a separate, inverted double simplex.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s start with quarks, and in particular the two types of quarks that make up the protons and neutrons inside atomic nuclei. These are the up quark, which possesses two-thirds of a unit of electric charge, and the down quark, with an electric charge of −1/3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up and down quarks can be either “left-handed” or “right-handed” depending on whether they are spinning clockwise or counterclockwise with respect to their direction of motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Left-handed up and down quarks can transform into each other, via an interaction called the weak force. This happens when the quarks exchange a particle called a W boson — one of the carriers of the weak force, with an electric charge of either +1 or −1. These weak interactions are represented by the orange line:\n",
      "\n",
      "Strangely, there are no right-handed W bosons in nature. This means right-handed up and down quarks cannot emit or absorb W bosons, so they don’t transform into each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quarks also possess a kind of charge called color. A quark can have either red, green or blue color charge. A quark’s color makes it sensitive to the strong force.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strong force binds quarks of different colors together into composite particles such as protons and neutrons, which are “colorless,” with no net color charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quarks transform from one color to another by absorbing or emitting particles called gluons, the carriers of the strong force. These interactions form the sides of a triangle. Because gluons possess color charge themselves, they constantly interact with one another as well as with quarks. The interactions between gluons fill the triangle in.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now let’s turn to the leptons, the other kind of matter particles. Leptons come in two types: electrons, which have an electric charge of −1, and neutrinos, which are electrically neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with left-handed up and down quarks, left-handed electrons and neutrinos can transform into each other via the weak interaction. However, right-handed neutrinos have not been seen in nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that leptons do not possess color charge and do not interact via the strong force; this is the main feature that distinguishes them from quarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting together what we’ve done so far, we’ve got the left-handed particles on the left, while right-handed particles are shown on the right. They form the basic skeleton of Quigg’s double simplex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, a complication: For unknown reasons, three progressively heavier but otherwise identical versions of each type of matter particle exist. For instance, along with the up and down quark, there’s the charm and strange quark and, heavier still, the top and bottom quark. The same is true of the leptons: Along with the electron and electron neutrino, there are the muon and muon neutrino and the tau and tau neutrino. (Note that the neutrinos have small but unknown masses.)\n",
      "\n",
      "All these particles live at the corners of the double simplex. Note that a small amount of weak interaction happens between left-handed quarks in different generations, so that an up quark could occasionally spit out a W+ boson and become a strange quark, for example. Leptons in different generations have not been seen interacting in this manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "What other ways do particles interact with one another? We mentioned already that many matter particles have electric charge — all, in fact, except neutrinos. What it means to have electric charge is that these particles are sensitive to the electromagnetic force. They interact with one another by exchanging photons, the carriers of the electromagnetic force. We represent electromagnetic interactions as wavy lines connecting charged particles with each other. Note that these interactions do not transform particles into one another; in this case, particles just feel a push or a pull.\n",
      "\n",
      "The weak force is a little more complicated than we let on earlier. Aside from the W+ and W– bosons — the electrically charged carriers of the weak force — there is also a neutral carrier of the weak force, called the Z0 boson. Particles can absorb or emit Z0 bosons without changing identities. As with electromagnetic interactions, these “weak neutral interactions” merely cause loss or gain of energy and momentum. Weak neutral interactions are represented here by orange wavy lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s no coincidence that the weak neutral interactions closely resemble the electromagnetic interactions. The weak and electromagnetic forces both descend from a single force that existed in the first moments of the universe, called the electroweak interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the universe cooled, an event known as electroweak symmetry breaking split the forces in two. This event was marked by the sudden appearance of a field extending throughout space, known as the Higgs field, which is associated with a particle called the Higgs boson — the final piece of our puzzle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Higgs boson is the linchpin of the Standard Model and the key to why the double simplex arrangement makes sense. When the Higgs field arose in the early universe, it joined left- and right-handed particles to each other, imbuing the particles at the same time with the property we call mass. (Note that the neutrino has mass, but its origin remains mysterious, since it derives from some mechanism other than the Higgs.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a cartoon version of how this generation of mass works. As a particle such as an electron moves through space, it constantly interacts with Higgs bosons — excitations of the Higgs field. When a left-handed electron bumps into a Higgs boson, the electron might ricochet off it in a new direction and become right-handed, then bump into another Higgs and become left-handed again, and so on. These interactions slow down the electron, and that’s what we mean by “mass.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, the more a particle interacts with the Higgs boson, the more mass it has. Furthermore, the frequent interactions with Higgs bosons make those massive particles quantum mixtures of left- and right-handed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with that, we have the Standard Model of particle physics:\n",

      "Last Monday’s Wordle word was LIGHT. Lots of people had trouble with this one because their guesses led them to it from the back end, and they got caught up trying FIGHT/MIGHT/NIGHT/RIGHT/SIGHT. All of which are perfectly reasonable words, but there are so many of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I managed to get it in two, mainly because of a lucky first guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Later that day, I started to think that LIGHT might have been the only possible solution, given Wordle’s grading of LATER. And I figured I could proveâor disproveâthat by using grep and the list of five-letter Scrabble words I wrote about in my earlier Wordle post. Here’s how I built up my grep pattern, one slot at a time. I’m using egrep because I can never remember what needs to be escaped in “basic” regular expressions.1\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, I start with L:\n",
      "\n",
      "I figured the second letter had to be a vowel. Although LLAMA is a legitimate word, I refused to believe Wordle would be so evil as to have two repeated letters. And even if it were, the A had already been eliminated. So that set the second slot:\n",
      "\n",
      "The third slot couldn’t be a T or any of the eliminated letters:\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I was faced with the T being in either the fourth or fifth position. Instead of trying to come up with a complicated pattern that handled both cases, I decided to use two simple patterns: one with the T in the fourth spot and one with it in the fifth. With the T in fourth spot the full command was\n",
      "\n",
      "where you’ll notice that I didn’t allow S in the last spot. This is because, despite what I said about the prevalence of plurals in Scrabble words, a month of playing Wordle has led me to believe that plurals aren’t used. They’re allowed in guesses, of course, but I’ve never seen a plural solution.2\n",
      "\n",
      "The output was\n",
      "\n",
      "I doubt that Wordle would use LINTY, but LOFTY and LUSTY are pretty good words. So I’d already disproved my hypothesis about LIGHT. Continuing on with the pattern that had T in the final position,\n",
      "\n",
      "the output was\n",
      "\n",
      "LICHT is beyond the pale, and I had my doubts about Wordle using LICIT, but LIMIT is a perfectly good word. So that’s three or four words other than LIGHT that could have been the solution. I just wasn’t thinking straight when I convinced myself that my first guess had locked in LIGHT.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Thursday I got my comeuppance, as I flailed around trying to get the letter in the fifth spot:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucky for me there aren’t as many SHAR_ words as there are _IGHT words.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the way, I decided to check if LLAMA truly is the only five-letter word that starts with L and another consonant. Turns out I was wrong about that, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "gives\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I can’t believe LLANO or LWEIS would ever be a solution. And not just because LWEIS is plural.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please don’t write to tell me about ack or ag or ripgrep or any of the other improved greps. Their advantagesâand I don’t dispute that they have advantagesâdon’t mean enough to me to switch from the familiarity of egrep. ↩\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, of course I could go through the list of solution words in the JavaScript source code to confirm this belief, but that’s outside my code of Wordle ethics. ↩\n",

Last summer, Lupiano's wife and now-deceased sister were diagnosed with rare forms of brain cancer on the same day. His wife was similarly diagnosed with an abnormally large AN tumor, and his sister was diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), which has an incident rate of 30 out of every 1 million people, Lupiano explained in a Facebook post that he has been updating since March 7.\n",

      "Description: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language, pronounced vermal or by its initials, originally—before 1995—known as the Virtual Reality Markup Language) is a standard file format for representing 3-dimensional (3D) interactive vector graphics, designed particularly with the World Wide Web in mind. It has been superseded by X3D.[1]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VRML is a text file format where, e.g., vertices and edges for a 3D polygon can be specified along with the surface color, UV-mapped textures, shininess, transparency, and so on.[2][3] URLs can be associated with graphical components so that a web browser might fetch a webpage or a new VRML file from the Internet when the user clicks on the specific graphical component. Animations, sounds, lighting, and other aspects of the virtual world can interact with the user or may be triggered by external events such as timers. A special Script Node allows the addition of program code (e.g., written in Java or ECMAScript) to a VRML file.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VRML files are commonly called \"worlds\" and have the .wrl extension (for example, island.wrl). VRML files are in plain text and generally compress well using gzip, useful for transferring over the Internet more quickly (some gzip compressed files use the .wrz extension). Many 3D modeling programs can save objects and scenes in VRML format.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Web3D Consortium has been formed to further the collective development of the format. VRML (and its successor, X3D), have been accepted as international standards by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The first version of VRML was specified in November 1994. This version was specified from, and very closely resembled, the API and file format of the Open Inventor software component, originally developed by SGI. Version 2.0 development was guided by the ad hoc VRML Architecture Group (VAG).[4] A working draft was published in August 1996.[5] Formal collaboration between the VAG and SC24 of ISO began in 1996[6] and VRML 2.0 was submitted to ISO for adoption as an international standard. The current and functionally complete version is VRML97 (ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997). VRML has now been superseded by X3D (ISO/IEC 19775-1).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The term VRML was coined by Dave Raggett in a paper called \"Extending WWW to support Platform Independent Virtual Reality\"[7] submitted to the First World Wide Web Conference[8] in 1994, and first discussed at the WWW94 VRML BOF established by Tim Berners-Lee, where Mark Pesce presented the Labyrinth demo he developed with Tony Parisi[9] and Peter Kennard.[10] VRML was introduced to a wider audience in the SIGGRAPH Course, VRML: Using 3D to Surf the Web[11] in August 1995. In October 1995, at Internet World, Template Graphics Software (TGS) demonstrated a 3D/VRML plug-in for the beta release of Netscape 2.0 by Netscape Communications.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1997, a new version of the format was finalized, as VRML97 (also known as VRML2 or VRML 2.0), and became an ISO standard. VRML97 was used on the Internet on some personal homepages and sites such as \"CyberTown\", which offered 3D chat using Blaxxun Software, as well as Sony's SAPARi program, which was pre-installed on Vaio computers from 1997 to 2001.[13] The format was championed by SGI's Cosmo Software; when SGI restructured in 1998, the division was sold to the VREAM Division of Platinum Technology, which was then taken over by Computer Associates, which did not develop or distribute the software. To fill the void a variety of proprietary Web 3D formats emerged over the next few years, including Microsoft Chrome and Adobe Atmosphere, neither of which is supported today. VRML's capabilities remained largely the same while realtime 3D graphics kept improving. The VRML Consortium changed its name to the Web3D Consortium, and began work on the successor to VRML—X3D.[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "SGI ran a web site at vrml.sgi.com on which was hosted a string of regular short performances of a character called \"Floops\" who was a VRML character in a VRML world. Floops was a creation of a company called Protozoa.[15][16]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "H-Anim is a standard for animated Humanoids, which is based around VRML, and later X3D. The initial version 1.0 of the H-Anim standard was scheduled for submission at the end of March 1998.[17]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VRML has never seen much serious widespread use.[18] One reason for this may have been the lack of available bandwidth.[19] At the time of VRML's popularity, a majority of users, both business and personal, were using slow dial-up Internet access.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VRML experimentation was primarily in education and research where an open specification is most valued.[20] It has now been re-engineered as X3D. The MPEG-4 Interactive Profile (ISO/IEC 14496) was based on VRML[21] (now on X3D), and X3D is largely backward-compatible with it. VRML is also widely used as a file format for interchange of 3D models, particularly from CAD systems.[22]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A free cross-platform runtime implementation of VRML is available in OpenVRML. Its libraries can be used to add both VRML and X3D support to applications, and a GTK+ plugin is available to render VRML/X3D worlds in web browsers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 2000s, many companies like Bitmanagement improved the quality level of virtual effects in VRML to the quality level of DirectX 9.0c, but at the expense of using proprietary solutions. All main features like game modeling are already complete. They include multi-pass render with low level setting for Z-buffer, BlendOp, AlphaOp, Stencil,[23] Multi-texture,[24] Shader with HLSL and GLSL support,[25] realtime Render To Texture, Multi Render Target (MRT) and PostProcessing.[26] Many demos shows that VRML already supports lightmap, normalmap, SSAO, CSM and Realtime Environment Reflection along with other virtual effects.[27]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This example shows the same scene as X3D § Example.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In a March 1998 ACM essay, \"Playfulness in 3D Spaces -- Why Quake is better than VRML, and what it means for software design\", Clay Shirky sharply criticised VRML as a \"technology in search of a problem\", whereas \"Quake does something well instead of many things poorly...The VRML community has failed to come up with anything this compelling -- not despite the community's best intentions, but because of them. Every time VRML practitioners approach the problem of how to represent space on the screen, they have no focused reason to make any particular trade-off of detail versus rendering speed, or making objects versus making spaces, because VRML isn't for anything except itself. Many times, having a particular, near-term need to solve brings a project's virtues into sharp focus, and gives it enough clarity to live on its own.\"[28]\n",

Beyoncé’s was the assertive and empowered ‘Sasha Fierce’, who allowed her to perform with extra self-confidence and sensuality. “Usually when I hear the chords, when I put on my stilettos, like the moment right before when you’re nervous… then Sasha Fierce appears, and my posture and the way I speak and everything is different,” she told Oprah Winfrey in 2008. It was a strategy that she continued to use until 2010, when she felt she had matured enough to avoid the psychological crutch.  Inspired by an emotional meeting with Beyoncé herself, Adele followed suit, telling Rolling Stone magazine in 2011 about her creation of ‘Sasha Carter’. The persona was a combination of Beyoncé’s Sasha Fierce persona and the (real) country music star June Carter. Adele said the strategy helped her give her best to every performance during her breakout year.  Although the embodiment of a fictional persona may seem like a gimmick for pop stars, new research suggests there may be some real psychological benefits to the strategy. Adopting an alter ego is an extreme form of ‘self-distancing’, which involves taking a step back from our immediate feelings to allow us to view a situation more dispassionately.  Ethan Kross, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, has led much of this research over the past decade, showing that even small shifts in perspective can help people to gain control of their emotions.  In one study, participants were asked to think about a challenging event in the future, such as an important exam, in one of two different ways. The group in the “immersed” condition were told to picture it from the inside, as if they were in the middle of the situation, whereas those in the “distanced” condition were asked to picture it from afar – as if they were a fly on the wall. The differences were striking, with those taking the distanced viewpoint feeling much less anxious about the event, compared to the immersed group. The self-distancing also encouraged greater feelings of self-efficacy – the sense that they could pro-actively cope with the situation and achieve their goal.

The scan was conducted by an international team of 13 neuroscientists\\xa0led by Raul Vicente of the University of Tartu in Estonia. \\n\\nThe scientists were\\xa0originally conducting electroencephalography (EEG) scans on the patient to detect and treat seizures. When he unexpectedly died, the EEG machine kept running, providing the scientists a first-of-its-kind glimpse into the brain activity of a dying human. \\n\\n“This is why it’s so rare, because you can’t plan this,” Ajmal Zemmar, one of the co-authors of the study, told Insider. “No healthy human is gonna go and have an EEG before they die, and in no sick patient are we going to know when they’re gonna die to record these signals.”\\n\\nThe EEG brain scan found an oscillatory brain wave pattern in which activity in the brain’s alpha, beta, and theta bands relatively decreased and activity in the gamma band relatively increased. It’s thought that these oscillatory patterns, and an increase in gamma waves, suggest memory recall (the gamma band decreases external interference, allowing for deep inward concentration like recalling memories). Similar brain oscillations occur during meditation and dreaming.\\n\\nThis is the first time this has been proven in a human, although the concept looms large in our collective imagination. It comes back to us from people who have experienced near-death experiences, defined as when the brain has transitioned into preparing for death. Research into these experiences has reported intense memory recall and a panoramic review of one’s life. They have also reported a hallucinatory and meditative state and a sense of transcendence and bliss. These accounts cross cultures and religions. \\n\\nThe trope is so solidified it’s joked about in cartoons, like Family Guy, and used in movies like Babe: Pig in the City (Babe flees from a dog about to kill him).\\n\\nIn the 2001 film Vanilla Sky, the character played by Tom Cruise leaps from a building and as he’s falling, he sees his childhood, his parents, a dog, and the women he’s loved throughout the years his life. In the 1998 action film Armageddon, Bruce Willis’s character sees memories of his daughter and wife a moment before dying in outer space. \\n\\nPeople have been describing this phenomenon for millennia. In The Republic, Plato tells the story of a warrior who returns from death and recounts leaving his body. Hieronymus Bosch’s painting “Ascent of the Blessed” (1500–1504) depicts bright, white light at the end of a tunnel, another experience reported in near-death experiences.\\n\\nPrevious research into this phenomenon was largely based on anecdotal evidence. In a 2019 study, researchers compared stories of near-death experiences with stories of drug experiences, finding that ketamine, LSD, and the hallucinogenic DMT yielded strong similarities. Countless studies have examined the religious significance of near-death experiences, drawing on survivors’ accounts of transcendental and blissful states at the moment before they die. \\n\\nResearch has not concluded why the brain does this. For now, it seems that a flood of memories, a feeling of transcendence, and eventual bliss are one last gift the world gives us before we leave it for good.\\n\\nVideos showed snipers shattering the windows of the mosque’s Qibli prayer hall to point their rifles down at the worshippers.\\n\\nMako Komuro, who shed her noble title in 2017, is working on a show of Japanese hanging-scroll paintings at the New York museum.\\n\\nThis is the largest exhibition to date on the artist, activist, educator, and founder of New York City’s El Museo del Barrio.\\n\\nThese are what have been for me the most troubling and beautiful aspects of being a full-time critic and writer.\\n\\nKwon Young-Woo presents the viewer with a deeper sense of the reality that nature goes on, no matter what humans are doing to each other.\\n\\nOn view in Philadelphia through July 16, the project considers the intersections of image making, domestic violence, and the feminist movement.\\n\\nFor the five artists in From Scratch, starting from the elemental meant raising existential questions on the use of language and humor or irony in art.\\n\\nThe photographer chronicles her life as a queer woman of color born with HIV.\\n\\nThe 2022 festival includes exhibitions and installations by artists including Tyler Mitchell, Sunil Gupta, Mahtab Hussain, Brendan George Ko, Aïda Muluneh, and more.\\n\\nA suggested reading list from Red Planet Books and Comics highlighting Native American literary work.\\n\\nThis week, national participation in the Venice Biennale, teen depression in the US, the “pity me” personal essay, reimagining borders, and more.\\n\\nCrypto entrepreneur Sina Estavi tried to sell the NFT and recent bids stand at just a couple thousand.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tElaine Velie is a writer from New Hampshire living in Brooklyn.

From those details they develop delightful insights into reality. What do I mean? Let’s take a gander at Van Eyck’s “Arnolfini Portrait” to find out:\\n\\nArnolfini Portrait, Jan van Eyck\\n\\nThe most whimsical idea starts with what Van Eyck painted. Do you think anyone in the world has paid more attention to this room than Van Eyk has? Look at the prayer beads beside the mirror: \\n\\nPrayer beads\\n\\nDon’t they seem uncannily real? Well, art historians think Van Eyck put them through a magnifying glass to get them this right. A practiced meditator would find it hard to stare at prayer beads for more than a few hours, while Van Eyck must have spent days. \\n\\nThe more you look, the more details you uncover. Notice how rich the wife’s dress is: the intricate folds, the patterns, the material. I’m not sure anyone but the dressmaker could have scrutinized it with more care. And even the dog is gifted with attention; look at its fur! \\n\\nThe doggo\\n\\nTry it yourself [1]. Pick a random spot and zoom into the painting. You’ll discover a world of detail you hadn’t seen. From here, it’s safe to say that at least Van Eyck noticed details we’d ignore.\\n\\nBut is this true for all painters? Van Eyck was known to bring his paintings to life with layers of detail. How about someone like Monet, who didn’t follow that strategy? Let’s look at his water lilies:\\n\\nWater Lilies, Claude Monet\\n\\nYou’d be surprised. Monet actually created 250 paintings of water lilies in the same pond, to study the effect of light there. You saw 1 of 250, a devotion that engrossed close to three decades of his life. How much more do you think you’d see in a pond of water lilies, if you spent 30 years looking? \\n\\nOur brains ignore details and see the essence of things. We barely notice the prayer beads, and wouldn’t take more than a few glances at the reflection of water lilies. The brush, however, forced Van Eyck and Monet to stop and see more. From there is born the premise that painters notice details we’d ignore.\\n\\nNow details by themselves, although interesting, aren’t general. Who cares if Van Eyck was intimately aware of prayer beads or if Monet had a deeper understanding of a pond? Let’s zoom out and see some of the larger implications. Back to the Arnolfini Portrait:\\n\\nWhat's up with the fruit?\\n\\nWhy is there fruit by the window? How about the clogs? Do you see all the various symmetrical arrangements: the bead and the broom, the grey clogs and the red clogs, the couple’s position? And what about the colors? Why is the husband wearing a dark purple coat, and not a red one? Look at the wife’s gesture. It’s so maidenly, but why?\\n\\nPG originally shared this idea in a masterful essay [2], and I’ll adopt it here. Every painting Van Eyck made had a purpose; to affect his audience. He may have wanted to please, shock, or dazzle; the spectrum of human emotions were fully available to him. This also meant that every painting worked doubly as a test; did it achieve its purpose? The more Van Eyck painted, the more he discovered exactly what worked. \\n\\nSlowly but surely details amalgamated into patterns, and Van Eyck began to map our subconscious drivers. He discovered our inborn love of symmetry for example, and used it to masterful advantage throughout the painting. He discovered the gestures that make us feel innocence, and now we can’t help but see it in the wife. [3]\\n\\nWhen we look at his work, feelings and thoughts burgeon up, but we can’t put our finger on why. Well, Van Eyck could put his finger on why, and there comes the painter’s first insight: they learn what affects humans.\\n\\nAlready we hit an interesting philosophical plane. When you learn what affects humans, you’re bound to ask why. But it gets grander.\\n\\nI left the coolest part of this painting last. Look at the mirror:\\n\\nHacker level 1000\\n\\nVan Eyk painted the reflection! You can even see two folks peering back at the couple. [4] \\n\\nOutside the effort this must have taken, imagine what Van Eyck learned. How deeply have you thought about how light reflects in convex mirrors? I’d bet a lot less than Van Eyck after this painting. In fact, some have tried to see just how accurate Van Eyck was, and compared his depiction with what a real convex mirror would have reflected [5]: \\n\\nVan Eyck vs reality\\n\\na is Van Eyck’s work, and b,c,d are the mathematically correct versions. The similarity is remarkable. \\n\\nNot only did Van Eyck have to learn what affected humans, but the brush forced him to see deeply into the real world. The mirror is just the beginning. Imagine what he learned trying to draw the shadows. What about the chandelier? Here we hit the painter’s second insight: they learn to unravel the secrets of nature.\\n\\nAs a painters master these insights, they take the canvas to heights we couldn’t have imagined before. For example, look at Botticelli’s “The Birth of Venus”\\n\\nBirth of Venus, Sandro Botticelli\\n\\nStuff like symmetry here is obvious. But, glance over Venus’ neck:\\n\\nWhat’s up with the neck?\\n\\nIt’s longer than a normal human neck! Or look at her hands and shoulders, a bit lower and longer than normal. Botticelli hacked our minds. He knew what pushed our buttons, so he didn’t just describe reality, he accentuated it. He showed us a view of Venus’s elegance that could only be achieved through painting. [6]\\n\\nEventually, painters can eschew reality’s constraints in ground-breaking ways, and show us what our eyes could never see:\\n\\nStarry Night, Van Gogh\\n\\nThese insights touch on what makes painting art. Painting isn’t a rote exercise, but an inquiry into reality and perception. \\n\\nHere’s a jump: I think programmers have a similar experience [7]. Programmers at work notice details we’d ignore. From those details they develop delightful insights into reality. \\n\\nNow, programming is not as far along as painting yet; our art has just begun. Like painting in the early renaissance, our work is crude, but we’re accruing insight after insight. What are these insights? \\n\\nLet’s find out by answering a question: what would a programmer notice if they made an app for painters? We’ll call it pixel.fyi, and we’ll help painters draw stuff online. Here’s our goal:\\n\\nThe Goal\\n\\nBefore we get into what programmers notice, let’s learn what programmers do. Today our devices are so sophisticated that they seem intelligent, as though they “understand” what we want from them. \\n\\nHowever, this intelligence is an illusion built upon illusions, and is perhaps the masterwork of the pioneer programmers of our time. Computers aren’t intelligent. Instead, they do simple things, like add and subtract numbers, very quickly. \\n\\nTo a get sense, here’s the great-great-grandfather of our modern computer:\\n\\nAdding Machine\\n\\nHere we have three light switches labeled “1”, “2”, and “3”. We also have three light bulbs labeled “3”, “4”, and “5”. \\n\\nNow, would it be possible to wire things up so that if someone turned on our “1” and “2” light switch, the “3” light bulb would turn on? \\n\\nIt doesn’t seem so difficult, and we’d hardly call it intelligence, but if we did this we would have created a machine that could add 1 and 2! \\n\\nThat’s cool, but here’s something startling: though crude, our invention adds numbers faster than any human ever could. The answer comes at the speed of light through a wire; this means our machine can make millions of calculations by the time you finish this sentence.\\n\\nInterestingly, our machine also has the same advantage as modern computers, in that the answer comes quickly, and the same disadvantage, in that fundamentally there is no intelligence. \\n\\nSo what’s the big difference? Our machine is specific; it can only add 1 to 3. Modern computers are general; they can do any computation. Instead of wiring things up a specific way, modern computers let us use a computer language to simulate wiring things up in any way we like. It looks something like this:\\n\\nWith that code, it’s as though we “wired up” our great-great-grandfather machine! \\n\\nWe come to the essence of what programmers do. They write precise instructions in a computer language, to get computers to solve problems. Precise is the key word here, because at the end of the day it all boils down to switches that turn on and off.\\n\\nOkay, back to programmers today. The most whimsical idea starts with what they create. For example, in order for pixel.fyi to work, at the very least we need to let our users draw simple shapes, like circles or squares. \\n\\nWell, how would a computer draw a circle? Switches have no concept of “circle”.  Here’s one idea: \\n\\nCircle\\n\\nLet’s imagine the monitor is like a grid, where we can turn each pixel on or off. A circle is really all the pixels that are a specific distance away from a center point. If we could just figure out all the pixels to turn on, we’d have a circle! \\n\\nAnd how do we figure out those pixels? Let’s remember some math:\\n\\nTrig\\n\\nWe could draw a right-angle triangle going from the center to a point on our circle at any particular degree. We can then use trigonometry to find the x and y coordinates for the point! All of a sudden, we have a plan to draw a circle. Here’s how a programmer could express it in a computer language:\\n\\nFor every degree between 0 and 360,  we calculate the x and y coordinates, and we have our pixel. We can then turn_on  pixels, and voila, our circle is born! [8] Here’s how this would look: \\n\\nSo what’s the consequence of all of this? Look how much we learned about circles. Not only did we breath life to trigonometry, but we discovered the “essence” of a circle: it’s all the points that are equidistant from a center. And if you think about it, this is the same definition for a sphere! A sphere is all the points that are equidistant from a center in three dimensions. And now for a mind-bender: this must mean that “circle” exists in infinite dimensions; there’s a “4-D circle”, with points equidistant from a center! [9]\\n\\n4-D Circle?!\\n\\nOur brains ignore details and see the essence of things. When we look at circles, the only property likely to burgeon up is that they’re round. The computer language however, forced us to see more. Sound familiar? From here is born the premise that programmers notice details we’d ignore.\\n\\nNow details by themselves, though interesting, aren’t general. Who cares if we know more about circles than the average person? Well, let’s zoom out to see some of the larger implications. We can kick off with a roundabout journey, and take a look at algebra. \\n\\nDo you remember the kind of homework you did in middle school? Stuff like: \\n\\nx + 2 = 5\\n\\nHere,  x is 3. Now, where did x come from? When we write x, we are using the concept of a variable. But variables didn’t always exist! They were only invented in the 16th century.\\n\\nWhat did mathematicians do before? They used words. Instead of x + 2 = 5, they would write: \\n\\nThere is such a number, that when you add 2 to it, you get 5. What is this number?\\n\\nYou can already get a sense of how annoying this could become. If all you have are sentences, even the area of a triangle can get taxing to describe. With variables, we could write:\\n\\n1/2 w * h\\n\\nWithout variables, we’d be stuck with:\\n\\nPick one side of the triangle. Measure this side. Now measure the straight line that connects from the opposite angle, to the side you chose. Multiply these two numbers together, and divide by two to get the area.\\n\\nAt some point, problems get so complicated that we can’t solve them with words anymore; no person’s head could fit the space required. That’s where variables come to the rescue. x isn’t just any mundane character, but a shorthand for our brain: what was intractable before can now fit into a middle schooler’s head. \\n\\nThat's thrilling and begs the question: what other concepts exist like this that we haven't discovered yet?\\n\\nProgrammers think about this question all the time. Why? Let’s look at our code for clues: \\n\\nWe were a bit mistaken here. We assumed our center was at [0,0], and our radius was 20. What if we wanted to draw another circle, but this time with a center of [5, 5] and a radius of 15?\\n\\nWe could write this: \\n\\nBut already this is getting hard to think about. What if we wanted to draw a hundred different circles? We can’t just keep copying and pasting. We’d barely get to triangles before our program spilled out of our heads.\\n\\nWe’re forced to invent a new concept. Here’s one; what if our language had a “snippet”? A way for us to say draw_circle, with different options for center and radius: \\n\\ndraw_circle\\n\\nThis is how it could work:\\n\\ndef becomes our “snippet” making concept. Whenever we write draw_circle(…), it’s as though we run the code inside it, with center and radius set differently. \\n\\nJust like variables, def gives our minds a shorthand to think with. Now drawing a hundred circles is easy peasy. Not only that, but wherever someone sees draw_circle, they no longer need to think about how it works; if we find a more efficient way to draw a circle for example, we could change our snippet and nobody would be the wiser. [10] \\n\\ndef is just the beginning. Let’s keep going. Look at draw_circle again:\\n\\nWe can write it like this, but what’s really going on here? \\n\\nIf you think about it, we’re transforming one list (of degrees) to another list (of pixels). If we use an analogy in the real world, it could look like an assembly line:\\n\\nAssembly Lines\\n\\nThere’s one assembly line with degrees and a worker beside it. The worker picks up each degrees, figures out the corresponding pixel, and adds them to the pixel assembly line. \\n\\nIt took a sentence to explain, but it’s a valuable concept, and we can generalize it. What if we called this map ? A worker “maps” degre``e``s to pixels. Here’s how how our program could look now: \\n\\nNow whenever we see map, the assembly line idea pops into our head. Not only does it give us a shorthand, but it opens up a new world; what else goes on in assembly lines, and can we use those concepts to help us think better? [11]\\n\\nJust with circles, we were forced to invent snippets and map. Imagine all that we’d discover if we kept going: what about shadows? what about layers?\\n\\nThe computer can only understand precise instructions, and there are only so many precise instructions we can keep in our heads. The more complicated the programs we write, the more we’re forced to invent new concepts. From there comes the programmer’s first insight: they learn what helps humans think better.\\n\\nAlready we hit an interesting philosophical plane. When you learn what helps humans think better, you’re bound to ask why. But it gets grander.\\n\\nNow as we progress on with pixel.fyi, we’d want to support “undo” and “redo”. If a painter drew a smiley and didn’t like the nose, they should be able to “undo” it: \\n\\nScratch the nose\\n\\nHow could we support this? If we just turn_on(draw_circle(...)) all over the place, there’s no way for us to know what the last instruction would be. It’s time for us to look for a new concept.\\n\\nHere’s a new idea. What if we kept track of the painting over time? Something like this:\\n\\nPainting over time\\n\\nWe have a list that represents time. Any change we make creates a new “version” of the painting, and adds it to the list. A painting at a point in time is just all the pixels that are turned on then.\\n\\n“Current” points to the version we show our user. When they press “undo” or “redo”, we simply move “current” to another version in our list. \\n\\nIn our computer language, it could look something like this: \\n\\nThis would support undo / redo, but it also opens up some interesting questions.\\n\\nFirst, consider that when we think about a “painting” in real life, we think about it as the end result. But here, we think about a painting as all the versions that existed throughout time. \\n\\nTwo views\\n\\nIt’s convenient to think this way for undo and redo, but isn’t life actually like this? Unfortunately, we are stuck in 3 dimensions and can't travel through time, but if we could, we would see that identity encompasses time. A painting begun, even if it goes through change after change, is the same painting in the end. That’s the same with people; no cell in your body is existed when you were 5, but you’re still you. \\n\\nAnother interesting idea, how does change happen? When we draw, we think we irrevocably modify the canvas. But if we could travel through time, we’d see something different: the canvas would evolve. After all, if you add a nose and go back in time, you’d still see the canvas without the nose, so how could the canvas have been irrevocably modified? \\n\\nAs it turns out, my friend Dennis [12] was so intrigued by this idea that he once explored a 3D animation for it, and it was about painting to boot. Here’s his rendering of a painting that evolves over time:\\n\\nSo darn interesting. We’ve lived in four dimensions all along but never saw it like this. \\n\\nAnd the insights don’t stop. Remember, this is a multiplayer drawing app. Could “Stopa” and “Joe” draw a shape at the same time? \\n\\nOops\\n\\nThis couldn’t happen when painting in real life; our hands don’t move fast enough. But a computer moves real fast; it’s certainly possible that Joe sees a blue shape and makes it red, but by the time this completes, Stopa sees the same blue shape and makes it green. \\n\\nThis problem opens an interesting question about how we perceive anything in life! If your friend is in front of you for example, how do you see them? \\n\\nPerception\\n\\nWell, light bounces around the room. Some of it hits your friend and reflects into your eyes. Your eyes then process the light, which activates signals in your brain. Those signals in turn activate more signals, until a thought pops up: “I see my friend”.\\n\\nAll of this takes time, right? It feels instant, but it takes time for light to move and for signals to activate in your brain. This means then, that everything you see is from the past! \\n\\nWhen you try to solve problems like “Joe and Stopa change the same shape at the same time”, you realize at least computers always see the past. It’s awe-inspiring that our reality works the same. We just experienced a sliver of the programmer’s second insight: they learn to unravel the secrets of nature. [13]\\n\\nAs programmer master these insights, they take their work to heights we couldn’t have imagined before. Well, actually we don’t know this quite yet, because we programmers haven’t mastered the insights!\\n\\nIf you paralleled the story of programmers with Renaissance painters, we’d be at the Giotto stage:\\n\\nKiss of Judas, Giotto\\n\\nGiotto was early. Before him, most painters followed strict rules and their work was flat. He questioned assumptions, began to study nature, and made giant leaps in his lifetime [14]. Though his own work was still crude, in only a few generations Michelangelo would step on the scene. \\n\\nThat’s where the best programmers are today. Our work is crude, but we’re questioning assumptions and constantly looking for inspiration from nature. It’s so early that some of the best ideas are prime picking, and the state of the art evolves every year. We can already see astonishing results at the edges, like computers transcribing human speech with better accuracy or self-driving cars whizzing around roads.\\n\\nWe’re left in an exciting state. I’m curious to know what transcendence will look like in our field. Computers are faster than any natural organ in our body. They need no sleep, can work 24/7, can “distribute” their brains around the world, and run for millennia. What kind of surprises lie ahead for us? What kind of concepts will the Michelangelo programmers of the future be using? \\n\\nThese insights touch on what makes programming art. Programming isn’t a rote exercise, but an inquiry into reality and perception. \\n\\nWow, what a journey we just went on.  \\n\\nWe learned that the brush forces the painter to notice details that we’d ignore. The painter’s goal is to affect us, and successive paintings help them unravel our subconscious drivers. Invariably they discover secrets of nature, and eventually transcend it.\\n\\nSimilarly, the computer language forces the programmer to notice details that we’d ignore. Their goal is to solve hard problems, and successive solutions help them unravel tools for human thought. Invariably they discover secrets of nature, and eventually transcend it.\\n\\nIt strikes me, that perhaps all creative pursuits are like this. This essay was born from a conversation, where I tried to explain why I found programming so invigorating. I thought I’d start with painting as the metaphor. However, putting words to paper had me discovering details I had ignored. I was plunged into book after book on art and even expanded my thinking on programming. [15]\\n\\nThere’s an obvious utility to the output of creation, but even if there wasn’t, I think there would be an overwhelming reason to do it anyway, just for the insights you get. [16]\\n\\nI hope this got you thrilled about the beauty of making things.\\n\\nErnst Gombrich’s “Story of Art” influenced how I saw art throughout the ages. PG is a hero of mine, and his essays on hacking and painting continue to inspire me [17]. I am taken by Rich Hickey’s model for programming. His motivations for Clojure largely inspired the “Reality, II” section.

I am also not an expert in product or engineering - just someone who is trying to write down my thoughts :)\\n\\nBe less technical. That’s it.\\n\\nYou’re an engineer. You solve problems* by designing solutions to them that run on really advanced calculators. You do this for a reason. Perhaps that reason is that you are overwhelmingly concerned with the speed and logistics of grocery delivery, or maybe you’d just like to buy some groceries for yourself at the end of the month. Whatever the reason, you solve problems and you’re likely damn good at it (the solving of problems that is, not delivering groceries).\\n\\nBut you need to Be less technical when describing and thinking about how to solve those far-reaching problems and the atomic** ones that occur along the way.\\n\\nThat may sound blasphemous, but please bear with me for a second (or a few minutes). I am not saying that you should reject everything you’ve learned and cultivated over the years, but rather - you should learn how to communicate those things to someone who hasn’t had that same experience of learning and cultivation as you.\\n\\nOver time, our species has developed and refined thousands of languages. Structured forms of communication that are, for the most part, highly interoperable. That is to say, we have the means to translate between the most popular languages with relative ease.\\n\\nThis has enabled us to think about humanity, its ongoing survival, and its conflicts across geographies and cultures.\\n\\nWe have developed structured, formal rules for transferring information between each other to ensure that we can make informed decisions.\\n\\nBy that definition, the way we communicate with each other (by speaking, writing, illustrating, etc) - becomes a way for us to describe the problems we experience, and by extension - reason about solving those problems.\\n\\nSoftware engineering, in my opinion, has developed its own formal language for communication. It is so pervasive and commonplace in conversation on the day to day, that I would go as far as to say that it is in a way a steady-state natural language that lives outside of English (and perhaps has analogues in other spoken languages that I am not aware of).\\n\\nAs an engineer who operates in this environment*** - you would have mastered this language quite quickly - without realizing that it can be incredibly exclusionary.\\n\\nThis language is technical. (Which can be a term used in other professional disciplines to refer to language constructs specifically adapted to their discipline).\\n\\nThe problem when describing and thinking and speaking about problems in technical language, is that it automatically excludes people who do not operate in that immediate environment.\\n\\nThis might raise a flag and question for some people.\\n\\n“But surely, by working in tech, you should know these things?”\\n\\nAt face value, this may be a solid assumption and question. But this ignores the fact that not everyone that works in “tech” is working near engineering. That is, they are not tasked with producing solutions in code. They may work in a customer-facing role, or perhaps are exceptional at designing user interfaces. They have a different technical language.\\n\\nThis is when it becomes especially important to be less technical.\\n\\nSoftware is not the only discipline that has an exclusionary technical language. Mathematics, which is the lingua franca of physics (among other “hard” sciences), is typically exclusionary at the highest levels (take for instance the Navier-Stokes equations - a set of partial differential equations that was presented to me as a first-year engineering student that scared me into computer science). That has not however inhibited some of the world's greatest minds from attempting to make physics accessible (see: A Brief History of Time)\\n\\nAnother point to be aware of is that languages and the barriers between them can introduce constraints on how many “bytes” of information we can transfer between each other.\\n\\nConsider the asymmetrical information relationship between the German phrase:\\n\\n“Schadenfreude**”**\\n\\nAnd its “equivalent” English translation:\\n\\n“...means joy over some harm or misfortune suffered by another” - Merriam Webster\\n\\nThough not a perfectly applicable example, we can see that the English language, due to its rules and formalization, does not have a single word that describes the complexity behind the feeling of “Schadenfreude”. This is an inherent constraint in the English language as it pertains to its translation to German.\\n\\nSimilarly, regular English, may not have a single word or phrase that encapsulates the intricacies involved in implementing, for example, a full-text search engine.\\n\\nThis is a constraint that we have to be aware exists when talking about problems and the solutions. Discussions of ElasticSearch, Lucene and inverted indices may not transfer as much useful information as we think to our audience and peers.\\n\\nA word in regular English, e.g. “Search” - may not have a well-defined technical translation outside the implementation. This restricts our ability to think about the problem because suddenly, we are focused on implementing a search engine without fully understanding what someone might have meant by “search”. (Of course, this is a reductive view and assumes that engineers are focused solely on implementation detail 😉).\\n\\nIt is our job to make sure we communicate and problem solve using a shared set of rules.\\n\\nThis doesn’t warrant a paragraph or long explanation. The simple answer is that you have already got the interoperability layer between technical language and “regular English” in your head. As a consequence of understanding the technical details, you are best equipped to be the translation layer.\\n\\nBe less technical. Be an interface for the technical details. Translate.\\n\\nAll that said, there are times to be technical, or else the language wouldn’t exist. I think the nuance is that technical communication needs to happen at the right level of granularity. I would err on the side of caution of being deeply technical when the audience and your peers are for the most part, not engineers.\\n\\nI would be more technical in discussions and situations that are centered on scaling systems and improving their speed, but even in these cases, I would look first for the “regular English” motivations for scale and speed. Perhaps other solutions exist outside engineering?\\n\\nA contrived example of focusing less on technical details and paying more attention to regular English communication:\\n\\nA: Our users are complaining our system is slow!\\nB: Ah okay, maybe we need to optimize how fast our pages load up, it's probably an API problem - engineering can fix that!\\nC: Hold on, what part of our system is slow? Is it the app?\\nA: Oh I don’t know - it was one of our users that uses our app on his phone a lot.\\nC: Hmm, perhaps he has a slow data connection is slow? Can we look at his network speed on a dashboard or something?\\n\\nThe simplest advice I have is to write more regular English. As engineers we are:\\n\\nBut we are hardly writing for non-engineer humans.\\n\\nIt is my honest belief that to be highly effective at problem-solving for people, we have to be world-class communicators. Writing is a good start.\\n\\nThe second piece of advice would be to pay attention to highly successful consumer technology and open source projects. Focus on the decisions they’ve made that drastically changed their product, why those decisions came to be, and the technical constraints and impact those decisions had (and the way engineers had to translate those decisions into code, and back).\\n\\nAs an example:\\n\\nWhy did Twitter increase the word count on tweets several years back? And what was the implementation detail that backed that up? What technical constraints might they have faced? And how do you hypothesize their engineering team communicated those constraints?\\n\\nTo be quite honest, being less technical is something I am still learning how to do, so I do not have all the answers, and I doubt I ever will - but I think that if we as engineers can describe problems without leaning excessively on technical details, we’re all going to build better solutions.\\n\\nIf you enjoyed reading this, give me a follow on Twitter!\\n\\n*Most times these problems are experienced by people, or maybe they’re experienced by machines, but in some way - you are transiently solving for problems experienced by people\\n\\n**In this case, “atomic” refers to a set of problems that cumulatively may provide a solution to a larger problem. e.g. tracking drivers for a delivery platform (which in itself may contain smaller problems)\\n\\n***And if you were lucky enough to study an engineering discipline, were educated in this environment\\n\\n\", 'Image': None, 'title': 'Be Less Technical', 'Votes': '42 points'}]}\n",

So when the United States government warns of a piece of code built to target not just one of those industries, but potentially all of them, critical infrastructure owners worldwide should take notice.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the Department of Energy, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the NSA, and the FBI jointly released an advisory about a new hacker toolset potentially capable of meddling with a wide range of industrial control system equipment. More than any previous industrial control system hacking toolkit, the malware contains an array of components designed to disrupt or take control of the functioning of devices, including programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that are sold by Schneider Electric and OMRON and are designed to serve as the interface between traditional computers and the actuators and sensors in industrial environments. Another component of the malware is designed to target Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) servers—the computers that communicate with those controllers.\\n\\n\"This is the most expansive industrial control system attack tool that anyone has ever documented,\" says Sergio Caltagirone, the vice president of threat intelligence at industrial-focused cybersecurity firm Dragos, which contributed research to the advisory and published its own report about the malware. Researchers at Mandiant, Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft, and Schneider Electric also contributed to the advisory. “It’s like a Swiss Army knife with a huge number of pieces to it.”\\n\\nDragos says the malware has the ability to hijack target devices, disrupt or prevent operators from accessing them, permanently brick them, or even use them as a foothold to give hackers access to other parts of an industrial control system network. He notes that while the toolkit, which Dragos calls “Pipedream,” appears to specifically target Schneider Electric and OMRON PLCs, it does so by exploiting underlying software in those PLCs known as Codesys, which is used far more broadly across hundreds of other types of PLCs. This means that the malware could easily be adapted to work in almost any industrial environment. “This toolset is so big that it’s basically a free-for-all,” Caltagirone says. “There’s enough in here for everyone to worry about.”\\n\\nThe CISA advisory refers to an unnamed “APT actor” that developed the malware toolkit, using the common acronym APT to mean advanced persistent threat, a term for state-sponsored hacker groups. It\\'s far from clear where the government agencies found the malware, or which country\\'s hackers created it—though the timing of the advisory follows warnings from the Biden administration about the Russian government making preparatory moves to carry out disruptive cyberattacks in the midst of its invasion of Ukraine.\\n\\nDragos also declined to comment on the malware\\'s origin. But Caltagirone says it doesn\\'t appear to have been actually used against a victim—or at least, it hasn\\'t yet triggered actual physical effects on a victim\\'s industrial control systems. “We have high confidence it hasn’t been deployed yet for disruptive or destructive effects,” says Caltagirone.\\n\\nWhile the toolkit\\'s adaptability means it could be used against practically any industrial environment, from manufacturing to water treatment, Dragos points out that the apparent focus on Schneider Electric and OMRON PLCs does suggest that the hackers may have built it with power grid and oil refineries—particularly liquified natural gas facilities—in mind, given Schneider\\'s wide use in electric utilities and OMRON\\'s broad adoption in the oil and gas sector. Caltagirone suggests the ability to send commands to servo motors in those petrochemical facilities via OMRON PLCs would be particularly dangerous, with the ability to cause “destruction or even loss of life.”\\n\\nThe CISA advisory doesn\\'t point to any particular vulnerabilities in the devices or software the Pipedream malware targets, though Caltagirone says it does exploit multiple zero-day vulnerabilities—previously unpatched hackable software flaws—that are still being fixed. He notes, however, that even patching those vulnerabilities won\\'t prevent most of Pipedream\\'s capabilities, as it\\'s largely designed to hijack the intended functionality of target devices and send legitimate commands in the protocols they use. The CISA advisory includes a list of measures that infrastructure operators should take to protect their operations, from limiting industrial control systems\\' network connections to implementing monitoring systems for ICS systems, in particular, that send alerts for suspicious behavior.\\n\\nWhen WIRED reached out to Schneider Electric and OMRON, a Schneider spokesperson responded in a statement that the company has closely collaborated with the US government and security firm Mandiant and that they together “identified and developed protective measures to defend against” the newly revealed attack toolkit. “This is an instance of successful collaboration to deter threats on critical infrastructure before they occur and further underscores how public-private partnerships are instrumental to proactively detect and counter threats before they can be deployed,” the company added. OMRON didn\\'t immediately respond to WIRED\\'s request for comment.\\n\\nThe discovery of the Pipedream malware toolkit represents a rare addition to the handful of malware specimens found in the wild that target industrial control systems (ICS) software. The first and still most notorious example of that sort of malware remains Stuxnet, the US- and Israeli-created code that was uncovered in 2010 after it was used to destroy nuclear enrichment centrifuges in Iran. More recently, the Russian hackers known as Sandworm, part of the Kremlin\\'s GRU military intelligence agency, deployed a tool called Industroyer or Crash Override to trigger a blackout in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in late 2016.\\n\\nThe next year, Kremlin-linked hackers infected systems at the Saudi Arabian oil refinery Petro Rabigh with a piece of malware known as Triton or Trisis, which was designed to target its safety systems—with potentially catastrophic physical consequences—but instead triggered two shutdowns of the plant\\'s operations. Then, just last week, Russia\\'s Sandworm hackers were detected using a new variant of their of Industroyer code to target a regional electrical utility in Ukraine, though Ukrainian officials say they managed to detect the attack and avert a blackout.\\n\\nThe Pipedream advisory serves as a particularly troubling new entry in the rogue\\'s gallery of ICS malware, however, given the breadth of its functionality. But its revelation—apparently before it could be used for disruptive effects—comes in the midst of a larger crackdown by the Biden administration on potential hacking threats to critical infrastructure systems, particularly from Russia. Last month, for instance, the Justice Department unsealed indictments against two Russian hacker groups with a history of targeting power grids and petrochemical systems. One indictment named for the first time one of the hackers allegedly responsible for the Triton malware attack in Saudi Arabia and also accused him and his coconspirators of targeting US refineries. A second indictment named three agents of Russia\\'s FSB intelligence agency as members of a notorious hacker group known as Berserk Bear, responsible for years of electric utility hacking. And then early this month the FBI took measures to disrupt a botnet of networking devices controlled by Sandworm, still the only hackers in history known to have triggered blackouts.\\n\\nEven as the government has taken measures to call out and even disarm those disruptive hackers, Pipedream represents a powerful malware toolkit in unknown hands—and one from which infrastructure operators need to take measures to protect themselves, says Caltagirone. “This is not a small deal,” he says. “It’s a clear and present danger to the safety of industrial control systems.”\\n\\nMore From WIRED\\n\\nContact\\n\\n© 2022 Condé Nast.

There wasn’t anything wrong with his son — the youngster seemed to be developing at a typical pace, according to the height and weight charts the physician used. What Seidlitz felt was missing was an equivalent metric to gauge how his son’s brain was growing. “It is shocking how little biological information doctors have about this critical organ,” says Seidlitz, who is based at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCan brain scans reveal behaviour? Bombshell study says not yet\\n\\nSoon, he might be able to change that. Working with colleagues, Seidlitz has amassed more than 120,000 brain scans — the largest collection of its kind — to create the first comprehensive growth charts for brain development. The charts show visually how human brains expand quickly early in life and then shrink slowly with age. The sheer magnitude of the study, published in Nature on 6 April1, has stunned neuroscientists, who have long had to contend with reproducibility issues in their research, in part because of small sample sizes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is expensive, meaning that scientists are often limited in the number of participants they can enrol in experiments.\\n\\n“The massive data set they assembled is extremely impressive and really sets a new standard for the field,” says Angela Laird, a cognitive neuroscientist at Florida International University in Miami.\\n\\nEven so, the authors caution that their database isn’t completely inclusive — they struggled to gather brain scans from all regions of the globe. The resulting charts, they say, are therefore just a first draft, and further tweaks would be needed to deploy them in clinical settings.\\n\\nIf the charts are eventually rolled out to paediatricians, great care will be needed to ensure that they are not misinterpreted, says Hannah Tully, a paediatric neurologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. “A big brain is not necessarily a well-functioning brain,” she says.\\n\\nBecause brain structure varies significantly from person to person, the researchers had to aggregate a huge number of scans to create an authoritative set of growth charts with statistical significance. That’s no easy task, says Richard Bethlehem, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK, and a co-author of the study. Instead of running thousands of scans themselves, which would take decades and be prohibitively costly, the researchers turned to already-completed neuroimaging studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe world’s strongest MRI machines are pushing human imaging to new limits\\n\\nBethlehem and Seidlitz sent e-mails to researchers all over the world asking if they would share their neuroimaging data for the project. The duo was amazed by the number of replies, which they attribute to the COVID-19 pandemic giving researchers less time in their laboratories and more time than usual with their e-mail inboxes.\\n\\nIn total, the team aggregated 123,894 MRI scans from 101,457 people, who ran the gamut from fetuses 16 weeks after conception to 100-year-old adults. The scans included brains from neurotypical people, as well as people with a variety of medical conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, and neurocognitive differences, including autism spectrum disorder. The researchers used statistical models to extract information from the images, and ensure that the scans were directly comparable, no matter what type of MRI machine had been used.\\n\\nSource: Ref. 1\\n\\nThe end result is a set of charts plotting several key brain metrics by age. Some metrics, such as grey-matter volume and mean cortical thickness (the width of the grey matter) peak early in a person’s development, whereas the volume of white matter (found deeper in the brain) tends to peak by around age 30 (see ‘Brain change’). The data on ventricular volume (the amount of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain), in particular, surprised Bethlehem. Scientists knew that this volume increases with age, because it is typically associated with brain atrophy, but Bethlehem was shocked by how rapidly it tends to grow in late adulthood.\\n\\nThe study comes on the heels of a bombshell paper published in Nature on 16 March2 showing that most brain-imaging experiments contain too few scans to reliably detect links between brain function and behaviour, meaning that their conclusions might be incorrect. Given this finding, Laird expects the field to move towards adopting a framework similar to the one used by Seidlitz and Bethlehem, to increase statistical power.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow the world’s biggest brain maps could transform neuroscience\\n\\nTo amass so many data sets is akin to a “diplomatic masterpiece”, says Nico Dosenbach, a neuroscientist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, who co-authored the 16 March study. He says this is the scale on which researchers should operate when aggregating brain images.\\n\\nDespite the size of the data set, Seidlitz, Bethlehem and their colleagues acknowledge that their study suffers from a problem endemic to neuroimaging studies — a remarkable lack of diversity. The brain scans they collected come mainly from North America and Europe, and disproportionately reflect populations that are white, university-aged, urban and affluent. This limits the generalizability of the findings, says Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge. The study includes only three data sets from South America and one from Africa — accounting for around 1% of all the brain scans used in the study.\\n\\nBillions of people worldwide lack access to MRI machines, making diverse brain-imaging data difficult to come by, Laird says. But the authors haven’t stopped trying. They have launched a website where they intend to update their growth charts in real time as they receive more brain scans.\\n\\nAnother challenge was determining how to give proper credit to the owners of the brain scans used to construct the charts. Some of the scans came from open-access data sets, but others were closed to researchers. Most of the closed-data scans hadn’t yet been processed in a way that would allow them to be incorporated into the growth charts, so their owners did extra work to share them. These scientists were then named as authors of the paper.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the owners of the open data sets received only a citation in the paper — which doesn’t hold as much prestige for researchers seeking funding, collaborations and promotions. Seidlitz, Bethlehem and their colleagues processed these data. In most cases, Bethlehem says that there was essentially no direct contact with the owners of these data sets. The paper lists about 200 authors and cites the work of hundreds of others who contributed brain scans.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCan lab-grown brains become conscious?\\n\\nThere are a number of reasons that data sets might be closed: for instance, to protect the privacy of health data, or because researchers don’t have the resources to make them public. But this doesn’t make it fair that the researchers who opened their data sets didn’t get authorship, the authors say. In their paper’s Supplementary Information, they argue that the situation “perversely disincentivises open science, since the people who do most to make their data openly available could be least likely to merit recognition”. Bethlehem and Seidlitz contend that authorship guidelines from journals, including Nature — which say that each author is expected to have made “substantial contributions” to, for example, the analysis or interpretation of data — are an obstacle. (Nature’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher.)\\n\\nA Nature spokesperson responds that the issue was “considered carefully by the editors and authors according to our authorship policies” and that “all datasets were appropriately credited per our data citation policy”.\\n\\nUltimately, these concerns can be traced back to how researchers are evaluated by the scientific enterprise, says Kaja LeWinn, a social epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies neurodevelopment. She says that it’s incumbent on all of the relevant stakeholders — including funders, journals and research institutions — to re-evaluate how brain science can be properly recognized and rewarded, especially as these types of large-scale study become more common.\\n\\nNature 604, 230-231 (2022)\\n\\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-00971-1\\n\\nBethlehem, R.

Have you\\never written your nice scientific application in Lisp, only to be\\nrequested by people to rewrite it in Python, so they can use its\\nfunctionality? Or, maybe you\\'ve written an RPC or pipes library to\\ncoordinate different programming languages, running things in\\ndifferent processes and passing messages around to simulate foreign\\nfunction calls.\\n\\n\\n\\nCalling into C from other languages is much easier in comparison. A\\ndlopen() and a foreign function interface suffices to use library\\nfunctionality exported with the C ABI, without spawning separate\\nprocesses. Bindings written over such a C standard library for\\nlanguage X make it seem like the underlying functions really are\\nwritten in X. For cross-language inter-operation, this is the most\\nlightweight option available. Languages like Rust and C++ can use\\nextern \"C\" { } blocks to wrap their own functions in the C\\nstandard ABI, to expose their functions in exactly this way for the\\nforeign function interfaces of other programming languages.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor languages with a sizable runtime included (with, for example,\\nautomatic memory management, signal handling, etc.) such as Python\\nor even Javascript, having a way to expose functions to be callable\\nwith the C ABI is much less common. You quickly need to deal with\\nissues of how objects are represented internally, how to deal with\\ntype translations, and what happens when objects in memory move for\\nGC. Some other Lisp implementations like ECL (the E stands for\\nEmbeddable Common Lisp) and some commercial Lisps do support\\nthis use-case however: that of allowing Lisp libraries to\\nessentially be packaged up as a shared library linkable with\\nordinary object files where Lisp code is callable with the normal C\\ncalling convention.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome of you may already know you can use ECL for this purpose; ECL\\nis a great implementation, but it does lack some functionality and\\nfeatures that makes it unattractive for some.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you prefer using SBCL, you can now join in on the cross-language\\nprogramming frenzy too.\\n\\n\\n\\nThose of you who have used foreign callbacks in libraries such as\\nCFFI will already be somewhat familiar with how the Lisp-side\\ninterface works – you write your Lisp code normally and then\\ndefine C convention callable function pointers in Lisp through a\\nfairly comprehensive translation interface. With callbacks, you\\njust pass these function pointers as parameters to your foreign\\nfunctions. What\\'s needed to make Lisp callable as a shared library\\non top of this interface is to iron out runtime management and\\nlinkage issues, e.g. how do we initialize the Lisp runtime and GC,\\nand then how does the system linker actually find the C callable\\nfunction pointers defined in Lisp so that you can call those\\nfunctions normally as if they were written in C?\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll explain how to use low-level machinery now exposed in SBCL and\\nhow it works, and wrap up by talking about a convenience library\\nthat creates a high level interface for creating bindings and\\nmanages some of the details.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s take a classic example to illustrate this new functionality:\\nSuppose you want to write C code and call out to a library called\\ncalc. calc is written entirely in Common Lisp, full of classes\\nand objects and methods defining ASTs for a simple symbolic\\ncalculator. It has functions like parse-expr, simplify, and\\npretty-print-expr, where everything works on Lisp objects.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe\\'d like to expose these functions so that we can call these functions\\nfrom other programming languages using the C ABI. So how does it\\nwork in the simplest case of using calc from a simple C program?\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst, we need to define these function pointers in Lisp. The\\nprimitives SBCL now exposes to deal with this is through the macro\\nsb-alien:define-alien-callable. You can use this macro in the\\nfollowing way:\\n\\n\\n\\nNotice that for example purposes we just translate any exceptional\\nLisp conditions into the C return error code convention. The actual\\nreturned value is set through the second passing argument\\'s\\nout-pointer in typical C fashion.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow we\\'ve defined C callable function pointers associated with\\nnames. You can get the underlying function pointers with the\\nfunction sb-alien:alien-callable-function, which is useful for\\npassing these callable functions as callbacks to C. SBCL actually\\ndidn\\'t even have an external interface to callbacks before this,\\nand CFFI had been using an internal system interface which is now\\nsuperseded by this interface.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, we\\'re not too interested in callbacks right now. We want\\nto be able to call these functions from C! You can save the Lisp\\nimage containing new callable function pointer definitions like so:\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat the :callable-exports argument describes is the set of C\\nsymbols you want to initialize with the corresponding function\\npointers created with define-alien-callable. This image, when\\nstarted, has only two jobs: finish starting up the Lisp system and\\ninitialize these callable exports with the proper function\\npointers. It then immediately passes control back to C \\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s an example C file which uses these functions:\\n\\n\\n\\nNotice that there is a symbol, initialize_lisp, that we can use\\nto initialize the Lisp runtime. Its arguments are the same as the\\narguments you can normally pass to the main sbcl executable, so\\nonce the core name is specified and the runtime initializes the\\nfunction pointers we are going to use, control is returned to the\\nprogram.1\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce the Lisp runtime has been initialized, your function pointers\\nare ready to use, and calling them from C works just like a\\ncallback would, with the same type translation machinery used.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow comes the question of what to do with objects. There are\\nactually several:\\n\\n\\n\\nIn ECL, we don\\'t really need to worry about this last aspect too\\nmuch. Since the garbage collector in ECL uses Boehm, objects in\\nmemory never move, so you could get away with just passing the\\nobject address as a void pointer into C, and opaquely manipulating\\nthat in your non-Lisp code, as long as you have some way of telling\\nBoehm where in your C program Lisp objects can reside.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, this is an unworkable scheme with SBCL. The primary\\ngarbage collector used in SBCL is generational and\\ncopying. Therefore, passing an object address to the outside world\\ndirectly outside of the managed Lisp heap means that once that\\nobject moves, the pointer becomes invalid, and a segfault\\nensues. Luckily, the solution is not too complicated: A layer of\\nindirection for opaque pointers is all that\\'s needed to resolve the\\nproblem. This can be implemented in any number of ways, but\\narguably the simplest scheme is just to have a map associating\\nintegers (fixnums) to objects which cross the foreign function\\nboundary. If the map exists in the Lisp heap, for example by using\\na global hash table stored in a global Lisp variable, then GCs\\nsimply update the map values like everything else, and because\\nfixnums do not move, the keys to the map are therefore stable\\nhandles we can pass to the outside world. Since we usually only use\\nobject pointers opaquely, the indirection through the map can\\nsimply be handled on the Lisp side. This solution also solves\\nproblems 1) and 2) at the same time: the map lives in the Lisp\\nheap, so it will keep any objects in its entries live. When we want\\nto remove the reference to the object from the outside world, we\\nsimply remove the entry in the map. If that object is no longer\\nreferenced anywhere else, the garbage collector happily cleans it\\nup.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s illustrate this indirection by modifying the above example to\\nbe safe and also teach the C program how to clean up\\nmemory. Assuming we have Lisp functions make-handle and\\ndereference-handle to add this layer of indirection, we would\\nsimply change our callable definitions like so, allowing us to\\nremove unsafe raw pointer coercions. make-handle and\\ndereference-handle deal with Lisp fixnums coerced into opaque\\npointer values, so we know that they are always safe to pass\\naround.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow let\\'s modify our C example to include this type of handling\\nusing the exported function lisp_release_handle:\\n\\n\\n\\nAs you can see, we only ever need to make and dereference handles\\non the Lisp callable definition side, while the foreign world only\\nneeds to pass around these objects opaquely and know how to\\n\"free\" their references to these objects. Any time you feel like\\nyou need to peek inside the internals of Lisp object from the\\nforeign world, all you need to do is define an alien callable\\nfunction exposing that portion of the object. That way,\\ncross-language pointers can be kept totally opaque and safe through\\nsome indirection like through the handles illustrated above.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are some more sophisticated intra-process related issues I\\nhaven\\'t touched upon, including how the Lisp runtime interacts with\\nthe outside world in relation to signals, sessions, threading, or\\nfile descriptors such as standard input and out. In particular,\\nusers will need to be careful when using Lisp together with another\\nmanaged runtime in the same process, such as a Python\\ninterpreter. However, since many of these issues are general\\nproblems anyone running multiple systems in one process has to deal\\nwith, I won\\'t cover the myriad number of ways people use to share\\nprocess stuff. However, POSIX signal handlers can all be set and\\nremoved from Lisp itself in SBCL, if the need arises. Some examples\\nof ways Lisp implementations could use signals:\\n\\n\\n\\nDifferent builds of SBCL on different operating systems require\\ndifferent signals or do threading in different ways, so consult the\\ndocumentation for details.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile the functionality that SBCL exposes is fairly low-level, a\\nhigh level library called sbcl-librarian is in development (used\\nin, for example, the Quil language stack), which defines a\\ndeclarative interfaces for generating bindings for types and\\nerrors, as well as producing the corresponding Lisp callable\\ndefinitions. It also defines some API exports for important\\nLisp-side functionality such as the handles described above, as\\nwell as exposing the Lisp loader and debugger for loading and\\ndebugging Lisp code at runtime from the foreign world. Much of the\\ninterface is still subject to design and change, but hopefully\\nthings will stabilize soon with use.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, so now you have another implementation on the block for\\nembedding Lisp in larger systems. Go try it out!\\n\\n\\n\\nNote that behind the scenes, the symbols parse_expr,\\nsimplify_expr, etc. are all global variables that happen to hold\\nfunction pointers. They are not function symbols in linker lingo, but\\nfrom the perspective of C, you can call them the same as if you\\ndefined a normal function. Hence there\\'s only one level of indirection\\nto make the call on the C side, which is the same as the indirection\\nto call any other function from a shared library via the normal\\nPLT/GOT mechanism, which is pretty much optimal for cross-language\\nshared library linkage, if you ask me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Have you ever wanted to call into your Lisp library from C?

The new scripts use a Racket-like language (GitHub - racket/zuo: A tiny Racket for scripting) that builds especially easily, so it can be used to build Racket. Makefiles and configure scripts still serve as the main points to start a Racket build, so you can still use make and configure as before.

In the 1970s, physicists developed a set of equations describing these particles and interactions. Together, the equations formed a succinct theory now known as the Standard Model of particle physics.\\n\\nThe Standard Model is missing a few puzzle pieces (conspicuously absent are the putative particles that make up dark matter, those that convey the force of gravity, and an explanation for the mass of neutrinos), but it provides an extremely accurate picture of almost all other observed phenomena.\\n\\nYet for a framework that encapsulates our best understanding of nature’s fundamental order, the Standard Model still lacks a coherent visualization. Most attempts are too simple, or they ignore important interconnections or are jumbled and overwhelming.\\n\\nConsider the most common visualization, which shows a periodic table of particles:\\n\\nThis approach doesn’t offer insight into the relationships between the particles. The force-carrying particles (namely the photon, which conveys the electromagnetic force; the W and Z bosons, which convey the weak force; and the gluons, which convey the strong force) are put on the same footing as the matter particles those forces act between — quarks, electrons and their kin. Furthermore, key properties like “color” are left out.\\n\\nAnother representation was developed for the 2013 film\\xa0Particle Fever:\\xa0\\n\\nWhile this visualization properly emphasizes the centrality of the Higgs boson — the linchpin of the Standard Model, for reasons explained below — the Higgs is placed next to the photon and gluon, even though in reality the Higgs doesn’t affect those particles. And the quadrants of the circle are misleading — implying, for instance, that the photon only couples to the particles it touches, which isn’t the case.\\n\\nChris Quigg, a particle physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, has been thinking about how to visualize the Standard Model for decades, hoping that a more powerful visual representation would help familiarize people with the known particles of nature and prompt them to think about how these particles might fit into a larger, more complete theoretical framework. Quigg’s visual representation shows more of the Standard Model’s underlying order and structure. He calls his scheme the “double simplex” representation, because the left-handed and right-handed particles of nature each form a simplex — a generalization of a triangle. We have adopted Quigg’s scheme and made further modifications.\\n\\nLet’s build up the double simplex from scratch.\\n\\nMatter particles come in two main varieties, leptons and quarks. (Note that, for every kind of matter particle in nature, there is also an antimatter particle, which has the same mass but is opposite in every other way. As other Standard Model visualizations have done, we elide antimatter, which would form a separate, inverted double simplex.)\\n\\nLet’s start with quarks, and in particular the two types of quarks that make up the protons and neutrons inside atomic nuclei. These are the up quark, which possesses two-thirds of a unit of electric charge, and the down quark, with an electric charge of −1/3.\\n\\nUp and down quarks can be either “left-handed” or “right-handed” depending on whether they are spinning clockwise or counterclockwise with respect to their direction of motion.\\n\\nLeft-handed up and down quarks can transform into each other, via an interaction called the weak force. This happens when the quarks exchange a particle called a W boson — one of the carriers of the weak force, with an electric charge of either +1 or −1. These weak interactions are represented by the orange line:\\n\\nStrangely, there are no right-handed W bosons in nature. This means right-handed up and down quarks cannot emit or absorb W bosons, so they don’t transform into each other.\\n\\nQuarks also possess a kind of charge called color. A quark can have either red, green or blue color charge. A quark’s color makes it sensitive to the strong force.\\n\\nThe strong force binds quarks of different colors together into composite particles such as protons and neutrons, which are “colorless,” with no net color charge.\\n\\nQuarks transform from one color to another by absorbing or emitting particles called gluons, the carriers of the strong force. These interactions form the sides of a triangle. Because gluons possess color charge themselves, they constantly interact with one another as well as with quarks. The interactions between gluons fill the triangle in.\\n\\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\\n\\nNow let’s turn to the leptons, the other kind of matter particles. Leptons come in two types: electrons, which have an electric charge of −1, and neutrinos, which are electrically neutral.\\n\\nAs with left-handed up and down quarks, left-handed electrons and neutrinos can transform into each other via the weak interaction. However, right-handed neutrinos have not been seen in nature.\\n\\nNote that leptons do not possess color charge and do not interact via the strong force; this is the main feature that distinguishes them from quarks.\\n\\nPutting together what we’ve done so far, we’ve got the left-handed particles on the left, while right-handed particles are shown on the right. They form the basic skeleton of Quigg’s double simplex.\\n\\nNow, a complication: For unknown reasons, three progressively heavier but otherwise identical versions of each type of matter particle exist. For instance, along with the up and down quark, there’s the charm and strange quark and, heavier still, the top and bottom quark. The same is true of the leptons: Along with the electron and electron neutrino, there are the muon and muon neutrino and the tau and tau neutrino. (Note that the neutrinos have small but unknown masses.)\\n\\nAll these particles live at the corners of the double simplex. Note that a small amount of weak interaction happens between left-handed quarks in different generations, so that an up quark could occasionally spit out a W+ boson and become a strange quark, for example. Leptons in different generations have not been seen interacting in this manner.\\n\\nWhat other ways do particles interact with one another? We mentioned already that many matter particles have electric charge — all, in fact, except neutrinos. What it means to have electric charge is that these particles are sensitive to the electromagnetic force. They interact with one another by exchanging photons, the carriers of the electromagnetic force. We represent electromagnetic interactions as wavy lines connecting charged particles with each other. Note that these interactions do not transform particles into one another; in this case, particles just feel a push or a pull.\\n\\nThe weak force is a little more complicated than we let on earlier. Aside from the W+ and W– bosons — the electrically charged carriers of the weak force — there is also a neutral carrier of the weak force, called the Z0 boson. Particles can absorb or emit Z0 bosons without changing identities. As with electromagnetic interactions, these “weak neutral interactions” merely cause loss or gain of energy and momentum. Weak neutral interactions are represented here by orange wavy lines.\\n\\nIt’s no coincidence that the weak neutral interactions closely resemble the electromagnetic interactions. The weak and electromagnetic forces both descend from a single force that existed in the first moments of the universe, called the electroweak interaction.\\n\\nAs the universe cooled, an event known as electroweak symmetry breaking split the forces in two. This event was marked by the sudden appearance of a field extending throughout space, known as the Higgs field, which is associated with a particle called the Higgs boson — the final piece of our puzzle.\\n\\nThe Higgs boson is the linchpin of the Standard Model and the key to why the double simplex arrangement makes sense. When the Higgs field arose in the early universe, it joined left- and right-handed particles to each other, imbuing the particles at the same time with the property we call mass. (Note that the neutrino has mass, but its origin remains mysterious, since it derives from some mechanism other than the Higgs.)\\n\\nHere’s a cartoon version of how this generation of mass works. As a particle such as an electron moves through space, it constantly interacts with Higgs bosons — excitations of the Higgs field. When a left-handed electron bumps into a Higgs boson, the electron might ricochet off it in a new direction and become right-handed, then bump into another Higgs and become left-handed again, and so on. These interactions slow down the electron, and that’s what we mean by “mass.”\\n\\nIn general, the more a particle interacts with the Higgs boson, the more mass it has. Furthermore, the frequent interactions with Higgs bosons make those massive particles quantum mixtures of left- and right-handed.\\n\\nAnd with that, we have the Standard Model of particle physics:\\n\\nModel by Olena Shmahalo/Quanta Magazine\\n\\nA 2D version of the full double-simplex model is available\\xa0here.\\n\\nSenior Editor\\n\\nArt Director\\n\\nFormer Graphics Editor\\n\\nOctober 22, 2020\\n\\nGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox\\n\\nGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\\n\\nQuanta Magazine moderates comments to\\xa0facilitate an informed, substantive, civil conversation.

Do you want all\\nyour desktop files visible on your linuxboot system, but just remembered there’s\\nno disk on your linuxboot system? Are you tired of using scp or wget to move\\nfiles around? Do you want to run emacs or vim on the linuxboot machine, but\\nknow they can’t ever fit? What about zsh? How about being able to run commands\\non your linuxboot machine and have the output appear on your home file system?\\nYou say you’d like to make this all work without having to fill out web forms in\\ntriplicate to get your organization to Do Magic to your desktop?\\n\\nPeople often need to run a command on a remote system. That is easy when the\\nremote system is the same as the system you are on, e.g., both systems are\\nUbuntu 16.04; and all the libraries, packages, and files are roughly the same.\\nBut what if the systems are different, say, Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.10? What\\nif one is Centos, the other Debian? What if a required package is missing on the\\nremote system, even though in all other ways they are the same?\\n\\nWhile these systems are both Linux, and hence can provide Application Binary\\nInterface (ABI) stability at the system call boundary, above that boundary\\nstability vanishes. Even small variations between Ubuntu versions matter: symbol\\nversions in C libraries differ, files are moved, and so on.\\n\\nWhat is a user to do if they want to build a binary on one system, and run it on\\nanother system?\\n\\nThe simplest approach is to copy the source to that other system and compile it.\\nThat works sometimes. But there are limits: copying the source might not be\\nallowed; the code might not even compile on the remote system; some support code\\nmight not be available, as for a library; and for embedded systems, there might\\nnot be a compiler on the remote system. Copy and compile is not always an\\noption. In fact it rarely works nowadays, when even different Linux\\ndistributions are incompatible.\\n\\nThe next option is to use static linking. Static linking is the oldest form of\\nbinary on Linux systems. While it has the downside of creating larger binaries,\\nin an age of efficient compilers that remove dead code, 100 gigabit networks,\\nand giant disks and memory, that penalty is not the problem it once was. The\\ngrowth in size of static binaries is nothing like the growth in efficiency and\\nscale of our resources. Nevertheless, static linking is frowned upon nowadays and\\nmany libraries are only made available for dynamic linking.\\n\\nOur user might use one of the many tools that package a binary and all its\\nlibraries into a single file, to be executed elsewhere. The u-root project even\\noffers one such tool, called pox, for portable executables. Pox uses the\\ndynamic loader to figure out all the shared libraries a program uses, and place\\nthem into the archive as well. Further, the user can specify additional files to\\ncarry along in case they are needed.\\n\\nThe problem here is that, if our user cares about binary size, this option is\\neven worse. Deadcode removal won’t work; the whole shared library has to be\\ncarried along. Nevertheless, this can work, in some cases.\\n\\nSo our user packages up their executable using pox or a similar tool, uses\\nscp to get it to the remote machine, logs in via ssh, and all seems to be\\nwell, until at some point there is another message about a missing shared\\nlibrary! How can this be? The program that packaged it up checked for all\\npossible shared libraries.\\n\\nUnfortunately, shared libraries are now in the habit of loading other shared\\nlibraries, as determined by reading text files. It’s no longer possible to know\\nwhat shared libraries are used; they can even change from one run of the program\\nto the next. One can not find them all just by reading the shared library\\nitself. A good example is the name service switch library, which uses\\n/etc/nsswitch.conf to find other shared libraries. If nsswitch.conf is\\nmissing, or a library is missing, some versions of the name service switch\\nlibrary will core dump.\\n\\nNot only must our user remember to bring along /etc/nsswitch.conf, they must\\nalso remember to bring along all the libraries it might use. This is also true\\nof other services such as Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). And,\\nfurther, the program they bring along might run other programs, with their own\\ndependencies. At some point, as the set of files grows, frustrated users might\\ndecide to gather up all of /etc/, /bin, and other directories, in the hope\\nthat a wide enough net might bring along all that’s needed. The remote system\\nwill need lots of spare disk or memory! We’re right back where we started, with\\ntoo many files for too little space.\\n\\nIn the worst case, to properly run a binary from one system, on another system,\\none must copy everything in the local file system to the remote system. That is\\nobviously difficult, and might be impossible if the remote system has no disk,\\nonly memory.\\n\\nOne might propose having the remote system mount the local system via NFS or\\nSamba. While this was a common approach years ago, it comes with its own set of\\nproblems: all the remote systems are now hostage to the reliability of the NFS\\nor Samba server. But there’s a bigger problem: there is still no guarantee that\\nthe remote system is using the same library versions and files that the user’s\\ndesktop is using. The NFS server might provide, e.g., Suse, to the remote\\nsystem; the user’s desktop might be running Ubuntu. If the user compiles on\\ntheir desktop, the binary might still not run on the remote system, as the Suse\\nlibraries might be different. This is a common problem.\\n\\nStill worse, with an NFS root, everyone can see everyone’s files. It’s like\\nliving in an apartment building with glass walls. Glass houses only look good in\\narchitecture magazines. People want privacy.\\n\\nSsh solves the problem of safely getting logged in to a remote machine. While\\nthis is no small accomplishment, it is a lot like being parachuted into a\\nforeign land, where the rules are changed. It’s a lot nicer, when going to a new\\nplace, to be able to bring along some survival gear, if not your whole house!\\n\\nUsers need a way to log in to a machine, in a way similar to ssh, but they\\nneed to bring their environment with them. They need their login directory;\\ntheir standard commands; their configuration files; and they need some privacy.\\nOther users on the machine should not be able to see any of the things they\\nbring with them. After all, everyone who goes camping wants to believe they are\\nthe only people at that campground!\\n\\ncpu is a Go-based implementation of Plan 9’s cpu command. It uses the go\\nssh package, so all your communications are as secure as ssh. It can be\\nstarted from /sbin/init or even replace /sbin/init, so you have a tiny flash\\nfootprint. You can see the code at\\ngithub.com:u-root/cpu. It’s also small: less\\nthan 20 files, including tests.\\n\\ncpu runs as both a client (on your desktop) and an ssh server (on your\\nlinuxboot machine). On your desktop, it needs no special privilege. On the\\nlinuxboot system, there is only one binary needed: the cpu daemon (cpud). As\\npart of setting up a session, in addition to normal ssh operations, cpu sets\\nup private name space at important places like /home/$USER, /bin, /usr,and\\nso on. Nobody gets to see what other people’s files are.\\n\\nSsh provides remote access. Cpu goes one step further, providing what is\\ncalled resource sharing – resources, i.e., files from the client machine can\\nbe used directly on the remote machine, without needing to manually copy them.\\nCpud implements resource sharing by setting up a file systemmount on the\\nremote machine and relaying file I/O requests back to the desktop cpu process.\\nThe desktop command services those requests; you don’t need to run a special\\nexternal server. One thing that is a bit confusing with cpu: the desktop\\nclient is a file server; the remote server’s Linux kernel is a file client.\\nCpu has to do a bit more work to accomplish its task.\\n\\nCpu will change your life. You can forget about moving files via scp: once\\nyou ‘cpu in’, the /home directory on your linuxboot node is your home\\ndirectory. You can cd ~and see all your files. You can pick any shell you\\nwant, since the shell binary comes from your desktop, not flash. You don’t have\\nto worry about fitting zsh into flash ever again!\\n\\nAt Google we can now run chipsec, which imports 20M of Python libraries,\\nbecause we have cpu and we can redirect chipsec output to files in our home\\ndirectory.\\n\\nHere is an example session:\\n\\nIn this command, we cpu to a PC Engines APU2. We have built a kernel and\\nu-root initramfs containing just one daemon – the cpu daemon – into the\\nflash image. The APU2 does not even need a disk; it starts running as a “cpu\\nappliance.”\\n\\nThe bash is not on the cpu node; it will come from our desktop via the 9p\\nmount.\\n\\nThe bash and ls command, and the shared libraries they need, do not exist on\\nthe apu2; cpu makes sure that the client provides them to the cpu server.\\nThe home directory is, similarly, made available to the remote machine from the\\nlocal machine.\\n\\nA big benefit of cpu is that, as long as the network works, users can create\\nvery minimal flash images, containing just the cpu daemon, just enough to get\\nthe network going. Once the network is up, users can 'cpu in’, and everything\\nthey need is there. It actually looks like they are still logged in to their\\ndesktop, except, of course, truly local file systems such as /proc and /sys\\nwill come from the machine they are on, not their desktop.\\n\\nCpu, as mentioned, consists of a client and a server. The client is on your\\ndesktop (or laptop), and the server is on the remote system. Both client and\\nserver use an ssh transport, meaning that the “wire” protocol is ssh. In\\nthis way, cpu is just like ssh.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the situation for cpu is a bit more complicated than for\\nssh. Cpu provides resource sharing, but not from the server to the client,\\nbut rather from the client to the server. The cpu client is a file server; the\\ncpu server connects the kernel on the server machine to the file server in the\\nclient, as shown below. Things to note:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe startup proceeds in several steps. Every session begins with an initial\\ncontact from the cpu client to the cpu server.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first step the cpud does is set up the mounts back to the client. It then\\nsets up the bind mounts such as /bin to /tmp/cpu/bin. In the following\\nfigure, we compress the Linux kernel mount and bind mounts shown above into a\\nsmaller box called “name space.”\\n\\n\\n\\nNext, cpu and the cpud set up the terminal management.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, cpud sets up the program to run. Because the PATH variable has been\\ntransferred to cpud, and the name space includes /bin and /lib, the cpud\\ncan do a standard Linux exec system call without having to locate where\\neverything is. Native kernel mechanisms create requests as files are referenced,\\nand the cpu file server support does the rest.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy do we only show one program instead of many? From the point of view of\\ncpud, it only starts one program. From the point of view of users, there can\\nbe many. But if there is more than one program to start, that is not the\\nresponsibility of cpud. If more than one program is run, they\\nwill be started by the program that cpud started, i.e., a command\\ninterpreter like the shell. Or it could be as simple as a one-off command like\\ndate. From the point of view of cpud, it’s all the\\nsame. Cpud will wait until the process it started, and all its\\nchildren, have exited. But cpud’s responsibilities to start a\\nprogram ends with that first program.\\n\\nBut what happens when cpud runs that first program? Here is where it gets\\ninteresting, and, depending on your point of view, either magical, confounding,\\nor counterintuitive. We’ll go with magical.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, cpud sets up mounts for a name space, and calls the Linux\\nexec() call to start the program.\\n\\nWe can actually watch all the cpu file server operations. The file server\\nprotocol is called 9P2000. We are going to present a filtered version of the\\nfile I/O from running a remote date; in practice, you can watch all the opens,\\nreads, writes, and closes the remote process performs.\\n\\nThe trace for running date starts right when the remote program has called\\nexec, and the kernel is starting to find the program to run1. The file\\nopens look like this, on a user’s system:\\n\\nThe kernel opened /bin/date, determined what libraries (files ending in .so)\\nit needed, and opened them as well.\\n\\nWe can compare this with a local execution:\\n\\nNote that several files do not show up in our trace; they are in /etc, and the\\ncpud does not set up a bind mount over /etc. But the other files look very\\nsimilar. You might wonder why the local version opens /etc/localtime, and the\\nremote version opens /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles.\\n\\nThe reason is that etc/localtime is a symlink:\\n\\nThe access to /etc/localtime does not get handled by the server; but the\\naccess to /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angelesdoes.\\n\\nWhat about different architectures? What if we are using an x86 but want to\\ncpu to an ARM processor?\\n\\nWe can set the local cpu up to talk to a remote cpu that needs different\\nbinaries. We might have an entire ARM file system tree in ~/arm, for example.\\nWe would then invoke cpu as follows:\\n\\nAnd the remote cpud, running on an ARM, would be provided with ARM binaries.\\n\\nCpu can be a hard thing to learn, not because it is difficult, but because it\\nis different. To paraphrase Yoda, you have to unlearn what you have learned.\\nForget about copying files from here to there; when you cpu there, it looks\\nlike your files are waiting for you.\\n\\nYou can start experimenting and learning about cpu by just running it locally.\\n\\nIn order for you to try it out, start by working with the set of cpu binaries\\nat\\nhttps://github.com/u-root/cpubinaries.\\nWith them, you can create a bootable, mountable USB image that you can download.\\nThe image contains a cpu client that runs on Linux, a private key, and, when\\nbooted, it starts a cpu daemon and waits to serve cpu clients. The cpu\\nclient is statically linked and hence should run on any Linux from the last 10\\nyears or so.\\n\\nThe binaries include:\\n\\nusbstick.xz is a compressed USB stick image that is bootable. It will\\nuncompress to about 7GB. You can use the TESTQEMU script to try it out, or use\\ndd to write it to a USB stick and boot that stick on an x86 system.\\n\\nBe careful how you use the keys; they’re public. You should really only use them\\nas part of the demo.\\n\\nThe cpukernel was built using the github.com:linuxboot/mainboards repo. If\\nyou clone this repo, the following commands will rebuild the kernel:\\n\\nYou’ll first need to start the server, and we show the entire sequence below,\\nincluding unpacking the image:\\n\\nHow you run qemu depends on whether you want graphics or not: if you are not\\nin a windowing environment, add -nographic to the command below. In any event,\\nat the boot: prompt, you can hit return or wait:\\n\\nAt this point, the cpu daemon is running, and you can try the cpu command:\\n\\nYou can log in and notice that things are the same:\\n\\nrminnich@minnich:/home/cpubinaries$ ./cpu -key cpu_rsa localhost\\n\\nroot@192:/home/cpubinaries# ls\\n\\ncpu cpukernel cpu_rsa.pub extlinux.conf QEMU usbstick\\n\\ncpu.config  cpu_rsa    EXAMPLE      LICENSE        README.md\\n\\nroot@192:/home/cpubinaries#\\n\\nNote that you end up in the same directory on the remote node that you are in on\\nthe host; all the files are there. We can run any program on the remote node\\nthat we have on the host:\\n\\nAs you can see, /tmp/cpu is mounted via 9p back to the cpu client (recall\\nthat the cpu client is a 9p server, so your files are visible on the remote\\nnode). Further, you can see mounts on /usr, /bin, /etc, and so on. For\\nthis reason, we can run date and it will find its needed libraries in /usr,\\nas the ldd command demonstrates.\\n\\nIf you get tired of typing -keys, do the following: put your own cpu_rsa in\\n~/.ssh; and copy the cpu binary to bin (or build a new one).\\n\\nWarning! The cpu keys we provide in the repo are only to be used for this\\ndemo. You should not use them for any other purpose, as they are in a github\\nrepo and hence open to the world.\\n\\nSometimes, you don’t want all the /usr and /bin directories to be replaced\\nwith those from your machine. You might, for example, cpu into an ARM system,\\nand hence only need a /home, but nothing else.\\n\\nThe CPU_NAMESPACE is an optional environment variable that lets you control\\nthe namespace. It is structured somewhat like a path variable, with :-seperated\\ncomponents.\\nIf it is empty, cpud will only mount the 9p server on /tmp/cpu. If CPU_NAMESPACE\\nis not set in the environment, cpud will not expect a 9p server from the client\\nand will not do a 9p mount on /tmp/cpu.\\n\\nThis following example will cpu to an ARM64 host, sharing /home, but nothing else.\\n\\nFor an different architecture system, we might want to specify that the /bin, /lib,\\nand other directories have a different path on the remote than they have locally.\\nThe CPU_NAMESPACE allows this specifcation via an = sign:\\n\\nIn this case, /bin, /usr, and /lib on the remote system are supplied by /arm/bin,\\n/arm/lib, and /arm/usr locally.\\n\\nIf we need to test cpu without doing bind mounts, we can specify a PWD that requires\\nno mounts and an empty namespace:\\n\\nMaintaining file system images is inconvenient.\\nWe can use Docker containers on remote hosts instead.\\nWe can take a standard Docker container and, with suitable options, use docker\\nto start the container with cpu as the first program it runs.\\n\\nThat means we can use any Docker image, on any architecture, at any time; and\\nwe can even run more than one at a time, since the namespaces are private.\\n\\nIn this example, we are starting a standard Ubuntu image:\\n\\nNote that the image was update and then started. The /lib64 mount fails, because there is no /lib64 directory in the image, but\\nthat is harmless.\\n\\nOn the local host, on which we ran docker, this image will show up in docker ps:\\n```rminnich@a300:~$ docker ps\\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES\\nb92a3576229b   ubuntu    “/home/rminnich/go/b…”   9 seconds ago   Up 9 seconds             inspiring_mcnulty\\n\\nCPU_FSTAB=”myfs /mnt virtiofs rw 0 0” cpu v\\n\\ncpu -fstab fstab v\\n\\nmyfs /mnt virtiofs rw 0 0\\n\\nCPU_FSTAB=cat fstab cpu v\\n```\\nas shells insist on converting newlines to spaces.\\n\\nThe fstab can specify any file system. If there is a mount path to, e.g., Google drive, and it can be specified\\nin fstab format, then cpu clients can use Google Drive files. Note, again, that these alternative mounts do not use the 9p server built in to\\nthe cpu client; they use the file systems provided on the cpu server machine.\\n\\nThere are thus several choices for setting up the mounts\\n\\nFor reference, the command we used: cpu -dbg9p -d apu2 date\\xa0↩\\n\\n\", 'Image': None, 'title': 'The u-root CPU command', 'Votes': '20 points'}]}\n",

Lots of people had trouble with this one because their guesses led them to it from the back end, and they got caught up trying FIGHT/MIGHT/NIGHT/RIGHT/SIGHT. All of which are perfectly reasonable words, but there are so many of them.\\n\\nI managed to get it in two, mainly because of a lucky first guess.\\n\\n\\n\\nLater that day, I started to think that LIGHT might have been the only possible solution, given Wordle’s grading of LATER. And I figured I could proveâ\\x80\\x94or disproveâ\\x80\\x94that by using grep and the list of five-letter Scrabble words I wrote about in my earlier Wordle post. Here’s how I built up my grep pattern, one slot at a time. I’m using egrep because I can never remember what needs to be escaped in “basic” regular expressions.1\\n\\nObviously, I start with L:\\n\\nI figured the second letter had to be a vowel. Although LLAMA is a legitimate word, I refused to believe Wordle would be so evil as to have two repeated letters. And even if it were, the A had already been eliminated. So that set the second slot:\\n\\nThe third slot couldn’t be a T or any of the eliminated letters:\\n\\nNow I was faced with the T being in either the fourth or fifth position. Instead of trying to come up with a complicated pattern that handled both cases, I decided to use two simple patterns: one with the T in the fourth spot and one with it in the fifth. With the T in fourth spot the full command was\\n\\nwhere you’ll notice that I didn’t allow S in the last spot. This is because, despite what I said about the prevalence of plurals in Scrabble words, a month of playing Wordle has led me to believe that plurals aren’t used. They’re allowed in guesses, of course, but I’ve never seen a plural solution.2\\n\\nThe output was\\n\\nI doubt that Wordle would use LINTY, but LOFTY and LUSTY are pretty good words. So I’d already disproved my hypothesis about LIGHT. Continuing on with the pattern that had T in the final position,\\n\\nthe output was\\n\\nLICHT is beyond the pale, and I had my doubts about Wordle using LICIT, but LIMIT is a perfectly good word. So that’s three or four words other than LIGHT that could have been the solution. I just wasn’t thinking straight when I convinced myself that my first guess had locked in LIGHT.\\n\\nOn Thursday I got my comeuppance, as I flailed around trying to get the letter in the fifth spot:\\n\\n\\n\\nLucky for me there aren’t as many SHAR_ words as there are _IGHT words.\\n\\nBy the way, I decided to check if LLAMA truly is the only five-letter word that starts with L and another consonant. Turns out I was wrong about that, too.\\n\\ngives\\n\\nAlthough I can’t believe LLANO or LWEIS would ever be a solution. And not just because LWEIS is plural.\\n\\nPlease don’t write to tell me about ack or ag or ripgrep or any of the other improved greps. Their advantagesâ\\x80\\x94and I don’t dispute that they have advantagesâ\\x80\\x94don’t mean enough to me to switch from the familiarity of egrep.\\xa0↩\\n\\nYes, of course I could go through the list of solution words in the JavaScript source code to confirm this belief, but that’s outside my code of Wordle ethics.\\xa0↩\\n\\n\\nNext post\\nPrevious post \\n\\nThis work is licensed under a\\n

Last summer, Lupiano\\'s wife and now-deceased sister were diagnosed with rare forms of brain cancer on the same day. His wife was similarly diagnosed with an abnormally large AN tumor, and his sister was diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), which has an incident rate of 30 out of every 1 million people, Lupiano explained in a Facebook post that he has been updating since March 7.\\n\\n\"Their neurologist, who has been recognized as a global leader in neurosurgery by the World Federation of Neurological Societies, has treated and been involved with tens of thousands of brain tumors in his career. It is his belief my wife and I may be the first documented case of spouses having an AN, both roughly the same size and on the same side of the head…according to him, the odds are maybe 1 in a BILLION,\" Lupiano said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n      Al Lupiano was diagnosed with a \"very rare\" and abnormally large brain tumor in 1999 when he was 27 called Acoustic Neuroma.\\xa0\\n      (Al Lupiano)\\n\\n\"To say he was concerned when he discovered all three of us grew up in the same neighborhood is an understatement. Why? There is one well documented cause of brain tumors – radiation exposure,\" he continued.\\n\\nLupiano eventually arrived at a single linking factor between himself, his wife and his sister: they each attended Colonia High School in Woodbridge in the 1990s. But Lupiano was not initially sure that the high school was a link to the similar yet rare brain cancer cases until he made a request on Facebook for others who attended Colonia to reach out to him personally.\\n\\nPROMISING CANCER VACCINE IN THE WORKS UTILIZING SIMILAR MRNA TECHNOLOGY THAT COMBATS COVID: DUKE RESEARCHERS\\n\\nBy April 11, he had heard from more than 100 former Colonia High School attendees who had been diagnosed with rare cancers.\\n\\n\\n      Lupiano eventually arrived at a single linking factor between himself, his wife and his sister: they each attended Colonia High School in Woodbridge in the 1990s.\\xa0\\n      (Al Lupiano)\\n\\n\"[A]s of midnight Sunday 4/10, I recorded the 100th case of someone having a primary brain tumor,\" Luapiano said in an update on his Faceboook post. \"I never in my worst nightmare envisioned ever hitting this milestone. That’s 100 people with their life forever changed. 100 families having to be told the terrible news. 100 stories of shock and disbelief with the diagnosis. I pray we find answers…(as of 18:00 4/11, the list stands at 102 individuals).\"\\n\\nIn an earlier update, Lupiano said many of those who reached out to him about their brain cancer cases \"are former CHS teachers and staff members who didn’t live in Colonia, they just worked in the school.\"\\n\\n\\n      Colonia High School entrance.\\xa0\\n      (Google Maps)\\n\\nLupiano is an environmental scientist who tested ground samples for toxins over the course of his career and suggested that the school\\'s grounds could be contaminated, according to NJ Spotlight News.\\n\\n2021 DEADLIEST YEAR IN US HISTORY DUE TO COVID-19, DRUG OVERDOSES\\n\\nWoodbridge Mayor John McCormack told the outlet that his office initiated conversations with the Woodbridge Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Environmental Protection and the Agency for Toxic Substance Disease Registry about opening investigations into potential radiation exposure stemming from the high school\\'s campus. McCormack said the town wants local and federal involvement in the investigation.\\n\\nLupiano also suggested a potential link between Colonia High School and a Middlesex, New Jersey, sampling plant in his interview with NJ Spotlight.\\n\\nThe Middlesex Sampling Plant, which has since closed, is located on 9.6 acres, about a 30-minute driving from Colonia.\\n\\nIt \"was an entry point for African uranium ores known as pitchblende\" that were \"imported for use in the nation’s early atomic energy program, were assayed at the Middlesex Sampling Plant and then shipped to other sites for processing,\" according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) New York Division.\\n\\nThe plant received uranium, thorium and beryllium ores between the 1940s and 1967, which is the same year Colonia High School was built.\\n\\n\\n      Middlesex Sampling Plant to Colonia High School in New Jersey.\\n      (Google Maps)\\n\\nThe plant then \"decontaminated to the standards in effect at the time,\" though \"overlooked during decontamination were traces of radioactive materials that had been carried offsite over the years by wind and rain to yards of neighboring homes,\" the USACE New York Division said on its website.\\xa0\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"Also, records later revealed that in 1948, some radioactively contaminated materials had been trucked from the plant to the Middlesex Municipal Landfill (MML), one-half mile away. In the 1980\\'s, the contaminated residential properties were cleaned up, and the excavated soil was stored at the site in a specially constructed pile, known as the Vicinity Properties (VP) pile,\" the USACE New York Division\\'s website states.\\n\\nIt is possible that soil from the plant had been trucked to Colonia High School during its construction in 1967, NJ Spotlight reported.\\n\\nAudrey Conklin is a digital reporter for FOX Business and Fox News.

      "{'_id': ObjectId('625bcfe4ecee636c2d5676cc'), 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML', 'title': 'VRML', 'metadata': [{'_id': ObjectId('625bcfe4ecee636c2d5676cd'), 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML', 'Description': '\\n\\n\\nVRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language, pronounced vermal or by its initials, originally—before 1995—known as the Virtual Reality Markup Language) is a standard file format for representing 3-dimensional (3D) interactive vector graphics, designed particularly with the World Wide Web in mind. It has been superseded by X3D.[1]\\n\\n\\nVRML is a text file format where, e.g., vertices and edges for a 3D polygon can be specified along with the surface color, UV-mapped textures, shininess, transparency, and so on.[2][3] URLs can be associated with graphical components so that a web browser might fetch a webpage or a new VRML file from the Internet when the user clicks on the specific graphical component. Animations, sounds, lighting, and other aspects of the virtual world can interact with the user or may be triggered by external events such as timers. A special Script Node allows the addition of program code (e.g., written in Java or ECMAScript) to a VRML file.\\n\\n\\nVRML files are commonly called \"worlds\" and have the .wrl extension (for example, island.wrl). VRML files are in plain text and generally compress well using gzip, useful for transferring over the Internet more quickly (some gzip compressed files use the .wrz extension). Many 3D modeling programs can save objects and scenes in VRML format.\\n\\n\\nThe Web3D Consortium has been formed to further the collective development of the format. VRML (and its successor, X3D), have been accepted as international standards by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\\n\\n\\nThe first version of VRML was specified in November 1994. This version was specified from, and very closely resembled, the API and file format of the Open Inventor software component, originally developed by SGI. Version 2.0 development was guided by the ad hoc VRML Architecture Group (VAG).[4] A working draft was published in August 1996.[5] Formal collaboration between the VAG and SC24 of ISO began in 1996[6] and VRML 2.0 was submitted to ISO for adoption as an international standard. The current and functionally complete version is VRML97 (ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997). VRML has now been superseded by X3D (ISO/IEC 19775-1).\\n\\n\\nThe term VRML was coined by Dave Raggett in a paper called \"Extending WWW to support Platform Independent Virtual Reality\"[7] submitted to the First World Wide Web Conference[8] in 1994, and first discussed at the WWW94 VRML BOF established by Tim Berners-Lee, where Mark Pesce presented the Labyrinth demo he developed with Tony Parisi[9] and Peter Kennard.[10] VRML was introduced to a wider audience in the SIGGRAPH Course, VRML: Using 3D to Surf the Web[11] in August 1995. In October 1995, at Internet World, Template Graphics Software (TGS) demonstrated a 3D/VRML plug-in for the beta release of Netscape 2.0 by Netscape Communications.[12]\\n\\n\\nIn 1997, a new version of the format was finalized, as VRML97 (also known as VRML2 or VRML 2.0), and became an ISO standard. VRML97 was used on the Internet on some personal homepages and sites such as \"CyberTown\", which offered 3D chat using Blaxxun Software, as well as Sony\\'s SAPARi program, which was pre-installed on Vaio computers from 1997 to 2001.[13] The format was championed by SGI\\'s Cosmo Software; when SGI restructured in 1998, the division was sold to the VREAM Division of Platinum Technology, which was then taken over by Computer Associates, which did not develop or distribute the software. To fill the void a variety of proprietary Web 3D formats emerged over the next few years, including Microsoft Chrome and Adobe Atmosphere, neither of which is supported today. VRML\\'s capabilities remained largely the same while realtime 3D graphics kept improving. The VRML Consortium changed its name to the Web3D Consortium, and began work on the successor to VRML—X3D.[14]\\n\\n\\nSGI ran a web site at vrml.sgi.com on which was hosted a string of regular short performances of a character called \"Floops\" who was a VRML character in a VRML world. Floops was a creation of a company called Protozoa.[15][16]\\n\\n\\nH-Anim is a standard for animated Humanoids, which is based around VRML, and later X3D. The initial version 1.0 of the H-Anim standard was scheduled for submission at the end of March 1998.[17]\\n\\n\\nVRML has never seen much serious widespread use.[18] One reason for this may have been the lack of available bandwidth.[19] At the time of VRML\\'s popularity, a majority of users, both business and personal, were using slow dial-up Internet access.\\n\\n\\nVRML experimentation was primarily in education and research where an open specification is most valued.[20] It has now been re-engineered as X3D. The MPEG-4 Interactive Profile (ISO/IEC 14496) was based on VRML[21] (now on X3D), and X3D is largely backward-compatible with it. VRML is also widely used as a file format for interchange of 3D models, particularly from CAD systems.[22]\\n\\n\\nA free cross-platform runtime implementation of VRML is available in OpenVRML. Its libraries can be used to add both VRML and X3D support to applications, and a GTK+ plugin is available to render VRML/X3D worlds in web browsers.\\n\\n\\nIn the 2000s, many companies like Bitmanagement improved the quality level of virtual effects in VRML to the quality level of DirectX 9.0c, but at the expense of using proprietary solutions. All main features like game modeling are already complete. They include multi-pass render with low level setting for Z-buffer, BlendOp, AlphaOp, Stencil,[23] Multi-texture,[24] Shader with HLSL and GLSL support,[25] realtime Render To Texture, Multi Render Target (MRT) and PostProcessing.[26] Many demos shows that VRML already supports lightmap, normalmap, SSAO, CSM and Realtime Environment Reflection along with other virtual effects.[27]\\n\\n\\nThis example shows the same scene as X3D §\\xa0Example.\\n\\n\\nIn a March 1998 ACM essay, \"Playfulness in 3D Spaces -- Why Quake is better than VRML, and what it means for software design\", Clay Shirky sharply criticised VRML as a \"technology in search of a problem\", whereas \"Quake does something well instead of many things poorly...The VRML community has failed to come up with anything this compelling -- not despite the community\\'s best intentions, but because of them. Every time VRML practitioners approach the problem of how to represent space on the screen, they have no focused reason to make any particular trade-off of detail versus rendering speed, or making objects versus making spaces, because VRML isn\\'t for anything except itself. Many times, having a particular, near-term need to solve brings a project\\'s virtues into sharp focus, and gives it enough clarity to live on its own.\"[28]\\n\\n\\n', 'Image': None, 'title': 'VRML', 'Votes': '137 points'}]}\n",
